  <h1>The Ballad of Kaeru and Sasori</h1>
  <h2>Kendall Rice</h2>

      <p>Sasori-san (a scorpion) was peeking out one day</p>
      
      <p>From underneath the boulder where he whiled his hours away,</p>
      
      <p>And from that crack today looked just like every day before,</p>
      
      <p>And dear Sasori wondered if the world were made of more.</p>
      
      <p>He left his rock that afternoon and scuttled bravely forth</p>
      
      <p>To see just what the west was like, and east, and south, and north.</p>
      
      <p>For many days and many nights he wandered to and fro</p>
      
      <p>Until a river rose ’twixt him and where he wished to go.</p>
      
      <p>Sasori-san could scarcely swim; but ere his hopes were lost,</p>
      
      <p>He spied among the reeds a way by which it might be crossed.</p>
      
      <p>This Kaeru-san (a frog) was kind of heart and strong of leg,</p>
      
      <p>Of which Saso was well aware as he began to beg:</p>
      
      <p>“Good morning, Master Frog! Please help a creature in distress</p>
      
      <p>And ferry me across this stream, for I am flipperless.”</p>
      
      <p>But Kaeru said: “Dear sir, if I should bear you to that side,</p>
      
      <p>How can I know you’ll keep your stinger out of my poor hide?”</p>
      
      <p>To which the scorpion answered: “I shall not, for we’d both die</p>
      
      <p>If I did that—of all God’s creatures none swims worse than I.”</p>
      
      <p>“That may be true,” said Kaeru-san, “but who’s to guarantee</p>
      
      <p>That when we’re close to shore you won’t decide to murder me?”</p>
      
      <p>Sasori-san could only laugh. “My friend, you’ve thought this through.</p>
      
      <p>Supposing I desired to return? Why, I’d need you!”</p>
      
      <p>All this made sense to Kaeru, who posed just one question more:</p>
      
      <p>“But mightn’t you still sting me <em>after</em> we’ve arrived on shore?”</p>
      
      <p>“Kind Master Frog, you do me harm,” Sasori made reply,</p>
      
      <p>“For who on earth could ever will his savior thus to die?”</p>
      
      <p>So logical his arguments, so noble his intent</p>
      
      <p>That Kaeru-san, for all his skepticism, gave consent.</p>
      
      <p>The devious arachnid boarded then his faithful steed,</p>
      
      <p>Who kicked against the current with astounding strength and speed.</p>
      
      <p>Pure-hearted Kaeru-san continued on his watery track</p>
      
      <p>Until, with half the river left to ford, he felt his back</p>
      
      <p>Erupt in agonizing pain from Saso’s poison sting</p>
      
      <p>And croaked: “Foul wight, you’ve doomed us and you haven’t gained a thing!</p>
      
      <p>For surely you must know we both are now condemned to die—</p>
      
      <p>Sasori-san, you bastard bug, give me <em>one reason</em> why!”</p>
      
      <p>The last words gentle Kaeru heard on earth rang warped and shrill:</p>
      
      <p>“It’s just my nature”; then for frog and scorpion all was still.</p>
