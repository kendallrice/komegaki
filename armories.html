    <h1>Armories and Orchards</h1>
    <h2>Kendall Rice</h2>
    
    <div id="text">  

      <p>A certain land which time forgot, and not without a reason,</p>
      <p>Supports a pair of moss-encrusted mounds,</p>
      <p>On each of which a certain fruit is always found in season:</p>
      <p>Atop the one, the apple blooms;</p>
      <p>Atop the other, orange perfumes</p>
      <p>The balmy air that in that clime abounds.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>

      <p>A town sprang up on either hill, an eye fixed on the other</p>
      <p>Across the brook that blued their common green,</p>
      <p>Regarding it now friend, now foe, now alien, now brother;</p>
      <p>The Orangemen watched their city’s troves</p>
      <p>While counting up the apple groves</p>
      <p>And often made comparisons between.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>

      <p>For though they must have noticed that their crop was good for eating,</p>
      <p>They noticed somewhat quicker that the trees</p>
      <p>Were very hard, and rather long—just right, in fact, for beating</p>
      <p>One’s foe about the chest and throat</p>
      <p>And showering soil upon his coat</p>
      <p>And specially for buckling up his knees.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>

      <p>Our kingdoms waxed, their armories from orchards thus converted,</p>
      <p>And fashioned all their furniture from stone</p>
      <p>Against the day when fructal rights would need to be asserted,</p>
      <p>Preferring that their wood be saved</p>
      <p>And left intact, with limbs unshaved,</p>
      <p>To be applied to hostile flesh and bone.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>

      <p>The clouds had not been stingy with their leaf-refreshing beverage</p>
      <p>The year that Pax the peddler paddled by;</p>
      <p>The Orangemen, in their constant quest for military leverage</p>
      <p>Observing twenty apples more</p>
      <p>Than they had spied the year before,</p>
      <p>Resolved that every Appleman should die.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>

      <p>Without delay they fetched their saws, their scissors, and their scythes</p>
      <p>And razed their gardens for the public good,</p>
      <p>Surrendered all their finest crop for military tithes</p>
      <p>To outfit every Orangeman’s arm</p>
      <p>With plants to do the Apple harm</p>
      <p>And teach his skull the sting of citrus wood.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>

      <p>The Apple folk, suspecting something of the clash to come,</p>
      <p>Plucked up their barks with equal industry,</p>
      <p>Equipped themselves with trunks enough to knock the whole world numb,</p>
      <p>And ordered their defensive rank</p>
      <p>In rows along the riverbank,</p>
      <p>Which rows shocked Pax into soliloquy.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>

      <p>“I say,” said he to no one, for his kayak seated one,</p>
      <p>“Methinks the timber-wasters war anew,</p>
      <p>If which be true, my business in these hills has scarce begun—</p>
      <p>For surely folk who squander thus</p>
      <p>Their leaf and bark will make no fuss</p>
      <p>Should I relieve them of their silver, too.”</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>

      <p>Ere the celestial Orange could slip behind the mossy west,</p>
      <p>The swarthy sons of citrus had arrived</p>
      <p>Upon the river’s other shore, a bush on every breast—</p>
      <p>“On, Orangemen!” rang the opening shout—</p>
      <p>The water crossed, their leaves lashed out</p>
      <p>In vengeance for their fields, of rain deprived.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>

      <p>Horrendous was the din of bark on bark, and bark on flesh</p>
      <p>As bark-struck shrubplates fell from battered ribs;</p>
      <p>From blasted stumps to cracking limbs to fruit-sticks green and fresh,</p>
      <p>Organic mortar rained and crashed</p>
      <p>On human limbs already smashed</p>
      <p>Or punctured by the sharper truncheons’ nibs.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>

      <p>Among these scenes the Orangemen’s prince, a lad called Phloem, shoved</p>
      <p>In quest of Castle Apple, and the bed</p>
      <p>In which he might that evening serve the country that he loved</p>
      <p>By joining Princess Xylem there</p>
      <p>And shearing from her every hair</p>
      <p>Of Xylem’s celebrated maidenhead.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>

      <p>In Xylem’s room another man the princess had received,</p>
      <p>But this no Orangeman: this a wandering peddler</p>
      <p>By name of Pax, and neutral, if he were to be believed,</p>
      <p>Who vowed, for half the country’s treasure,</p>
      <p>To grant her from his wares a measure</p>
      <p>Whereby she might become the conflict’s settler.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>

      <p>This sounded fair to Xylem, and she presently escorted</p>
      <p>The peddler to her father’s silver store,</p>
      <p>Of whose supply precisely half he to his purse transported,</p>
      <p>Upon which Pax, no liar he,</p>
      <p>Bestowed on her the promised key</p>
      <p>That in her hands alone could break the war</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>

      <p>No sooner was the business sealed, the milky moon ascended,</p>
      <p>Than footsteps from the hall spooked Pax away;</p>
      <p>The door fell ope, and Xylem gasped, for what walked in was splendid:</p>
      <p>A lad becaped, bescarfed, in hose,</p>
      <p>Armed not with tree, but rather—rose—</p>
      <p>Yet feared she what the lad had come to say.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>

      <p>For his part, Phloem suffered unprecedented remorse</p>
      <p>When drank his eyes her beauty sad and pale,</p>
      <p>And yet to her “What will you?” quoth he, “Taste your fruit, of course”;</p>
      <p>His charging ram would not be lambed—</p>
      <p>Her startling eyes, pink lips be damned!—</p>
      <p>For Orange he’d ravish her and spread the tale.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>

      <p>Prince Phloem sneered and leveled papery petals at his prey;</p>
      <p>The princess Xylem heaved a ponderous sigh;</p>
      <p>Anon she drew a sapling with the pot wherein it lay</p>
      <p>And crossed his rose; her timor gone,</p>
      <p>Took one step forth—the duel was on,</p>
      <p>And something savage smoldered in her eye.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>

      <p>Without, the deafening music only trees make when they war;</p>
      <p>Within, the silent dance of rival fruits;</p>
      <p>One hates the other, hates her, but perhaps he loves her more;</p>
      <p>Two swish their brands in earnest strife,</p>
      <p>Two living weapons, starved for life;</p>
      <p>One thorn rends one white cheek—the crimson suits.</p>

      <div class="break"></div>
      
      <p>The prince transfixed, he dumbly stood, beholding life’s escape</p>
      <p>And praising that reserve which flowed beneath</p>
      <p>The gash his token lately carved—where now his taste for rape?—</p>
      <p>“I’m won,” she whispered, “nearly so—</p>
      <p>If you but take this box and go</p>
      <p>Back Orangeward, I my apple shall bequeath.”</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>

      <p>So dazed was simple Phloem that he straightaway complied:</p>
      <p>He seized the peddler’s box and took his leave,</p>
      <p>Fell back among his Orangemen, who prevailed to peer inside—</p>
      <p>An insect reared its feelered form—</p>
      <p>A hundred more—and then a swarm</p>
      <p>The citrus spears and rams began to reave.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>

      <p>Through celluloid these devils drilled as if through clotted cream,</p>
      <p>And tasted so, to see them chomp it down;</p>
      <p>Prince Phloem pinched, then punched himself in hopes it was a dream—</p>
      <p>His rose dissolved in insect jaws,</p>
      <p>His shoulders crawled with insect claws,</p>
      <p>His torso writhed below a chitinous gown.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>

      <p>Just when our prince had longed to change his flesh for celluloid</p>
      <p>So he might be devoured next, and so spared,</p>
      <p>Just then, his chief commander sent the swarm into the void</p>
      <p>By spraying something from a can</p>
      <p>It seems he purchased from a man</p>
      <p>Called Pax, with whom half Phloem’s silver shared.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>

      <p>The towns of Apple and of Orange kept up their little war</p>
      <p>As long as they had wood enough to swing,</p>
      <p>And gave it up abruptly when they found themselves too poor:</p>
      <p>For both sides ached from such a cost</p>
      <p>As made them claim they both had lost—</p>
      <p>But Pax the peddler rowed away a king.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>

      <p>The silver we have won today tomorrow may be spent;</p>
      <p>The tale we’ve weathered here we’ll soon forget,</p>
      <p>And time forgets us too, and leaves us wondering where it went;</p>
      <p>But even if the wind should freeze</p>
      <p>Our orchards and our armories,</p>
      <p>Be they but separate, there’s hope for us yet.</p>
