    <h1>What the Fish God Ate</h1>
    <h2>Kendall Rice</h2>
    
    <div id="text">

    <p class="first"><span class="dropcap">I</span><caps>n a sandy place </caps>stood a cactus. Prickly arm raised toward a bronze sky, it didn’t move a muscle. That was because it was asleep.</p>
    
    <p>Suddenly, something sharp and hot <em>thwock</em>ed into its trunk. It didn’t hurt—naturally, cacti don’t feel pain—but this cactus was angry to have been awoken. It swung a fearsome arm.</p>
    
    <p>“Got him!” squealed a girl’s voice.</p>
    
    <p>From behind a rock appeared a young man. A ponytail sprouted from the back of his bald head. “Riled him, you mean, Sunako.”</p>
    
    <p>As soon as he had spoken, he dove back behind the rock. A rain of needles clattered against it.</p>
	
    <p>“Just like that! Strip off those spines, li’l cactus,” cheered Sunako Pepperhill behind her own rock, several meters off. Her bowstring’s echo died away.
	
    <p>The moment the rain of needles stopped, the young man leapt out, unsheathed his sword, and set to work on the enraged cactus. A sweat-bead sparkled on his bald dome. With a theatrical whoop he impaled his foe. He’d done this kind of thing a few times before, but was still surprised by how easily the sword slid in. The vanquished plant writhed for a moment and dutifully collapsed.<p>
    
    <p>“All right!” Sunako appeared, lofting her bow in triumph.</p>
	
    <p>Kurobato Pepperhill held out his left hand and ordered, “Plug.” His sister rummaged through her quiver, removed something small and wooden, and handed it to him. Kurobato pulled his sword out of the cactus and stopped the wound with the plug.</p>
	
    <p>A few drops leaked out, but most of the precious treasure remained safe inside the cactus.</p>
	
    <p>“Sorry, friend,” murmured Kurobato. “We need this more than you do.”</p>
	
    <p>The two dragged the cactus over to a cart piled with six or seven more. Loading their latest quarry, they creaked back toward town.</p>
    
    <div class="break"></div>
    
    <p class="first"><caps>“Drink up!”</caps></p>
	
    <p>A pair of middle-aged men clinked mugs together. Kurobato, sitting between them, dodged to avoid beheading. Sunako tittered across the table.</p>
	
    <p>Cafeteria, eight at night. When the water brought back by the cactus hunters was doled out. Most of it went to the reservoir, but each night the biggest cactus was hauled into the center of the cafeteria, where thirsty folks were already lining up.</p>
    
    <p>The men around Kurobato were called Parkes and Segrin. Even before they’d run for headman Kurobato hadn’t cared for them, but since they’d taken to canvassing the guy who brought the biggest cactus, they were an even greater nuisance.</p>
    
    <p>For once, though, Segrin’s talk strayed from politics.</p>
    
    <p>“Say, you know which cactus’s water I’d really like to drink?”</p>
    
    <p>“What’s wrong?” said Sunako. “If you’re that turned off by the stuff we brought you, I’ll gladly drink it for you.”</p>
    
    <p>Seeing his rival scolded, Parkes snickered and slurped his water.</p>
    
    <p>“Beg pardon, Sunako—didn’t mean it like that!” Segrin reddened. “I just want a taste of <em>that</em> one’s water, y’know? You do too, don’t ya, Parkes?”</p>
    
    <p>Before Parkes could answer, Kurobato interjected.
    “<em>That</em> one doesn’t exist—’round here, at least. He’s smarter than you, Segrin. No doubt he’s living in some far-off desert, where we can’t find him. He’s no common prickler, that Cactus King!”</p>
    
    <p>“Still, wouldn’t it be something,” said Parkes, who’d been silent till now. “If you could take so great a cactus, the Pepperhills would surely go down in history.”</p>
    
    <p>“And I suppose you’d go down in history too, as the headman who pushed the Pepperhills to take so great a cactus?” snorted Sunako. “You’re lucky I’m too young to vote.”</p>
    
    <p>It was Parkes’s turn to redden. But no one noticed, for Kurobato had just slammed his mug on the table.</p>
    
    <p>“What history? A thousand years from now, no one will know this town was ever here. Even the cacti will forget.”</p>
    
    <p>“Kuro!” Sunako’s eyes widened, but her brother kept on.</p>
    
    <p>“Ain’t it so? Ain’t no one around who knows what was here a thousand years ago. For all we know, this whole desert was covered with water! But no one’s ever asked. The folks in this town care only for cacti. Don’t act like you understand a thing about history, Parkes.”</p>
    
    <p>For a few seconds, silence ruled the table, yielding to the moistened voices of the diners around. At length Segrin spoke.</p>
    
    <p>“Clever, Kurobato. To think, our desert covered in water! I bet if you opened up that Cactus King you’d find enough to cover it again.”</p>
    
    <p>Kurobato sprang to his feet. “Cacti, cacti, cacti! I’ve had it up to here with cacti. If they’re all you care about, I’ll bring you your king.”</p>
    
    <p>With this oath elicited, the two satisfied men forgot the matter and set to arguing which of them would make the better headman. Sunako, her face etched with worry, grasped her brother’s wagging finger.</p>
	
    <p>“We need the cacti, Kuro.”</p>
    
    <p>Kurobato went red himself but regarded his sister with his usual cool stare. “I know that, Suna. It sucks, but I know.”</p>
    
    <div class="break"></div>
    
    <p class="first"><caps>The next morning</caps>, between four and five, seven people set out from town. Kurobato, who’d openly sworn to take the Cactus King; the archer Sunako; Parkes (over Kurobato’s protest), hoping to go down in history; Segrin (also over Kurobato’s protest), refusing to be outdone; and three of the town’s finest hunters—all went to seek the legendary Cactus King. Why between four and five? As everyone knows, cacti take siestas and are best attacked asleep, so far-off hunts must be launched early. These hunters hadn’t so much as a map to help them toward the Cactus King, but felt generally that they could rely on the Pepperhills.</p>
    
    <p>Sunako didn’t feel that way. “Kuro… This trip is pointless,” she muttered.</p>
    
    <p>“Yup. At least our future headmen will want to forget about cacti from tomorrow.”</p>
    
    <p>Bathing in the sun’s hot glare, they alternately rode and pulled the cart, creaking all the way. They met neither Cactus King nor cactus commoner.</p>
    
    <p>Just when Parkes and Segrin had begun debating who, if they had to eat one of their party, could best be done without, something buried in the shining sand, bigger than could be believed, came into view.</p>
    
    <p>It wasn’t a cactus.</p>
    
    <p>It was a fish.</p>
    
    <p>The word <em>fish</em>, like the words <em>swim</em> and <em>boat</em>, was known to them if not quite understood. Kurobato as a child had learned such words by sound and practiced writing them by hand, but never had known why he was learning them. If he asked a teacher, “What does it mean to swim?” he’d be told, “You know flying? What a vulture does in the sky? Swimming is the same motion, but in water.” The explanation ended there. Perhaps such words would come in handy if he wanted to write fantasy stories, but no one in town wrote stories of any kind. That words for nonexistent things could stick around struck Kurobato as queer. No one but Sunako would hear him talk about it.</p>
    
    <p>Even so, the monster buried here was definitely a fish. Its head tapered like a beak, and blades soared like range of thin mountains from the flat of its back to its tail. Every part of its armor-plated surface gleamed. Only the bulging eyes were dull. It looked altogether dead.</p>
    
    <p>“What in blazes—” began Segrin.</p>
    
    <p>“—is that?” Parkes finished weakly.</p>
    
    <p>Kurobato, lacking a proper answer, just scratched his bald head.</p>
    
    <p>“Pretty,” said Sunako, running up in apparent satisfaction.</p>
    
    <p>Kurobato couldn’t say whether he agreed, but he did find the beast overwhelming. It was bigger than any animal, and certainly not native to the desert. Whatever in blazes it was, he knew, it was much more consequential than any Cactus King.</p>
    
    <p>“Kuro! The mouth’s open a little!”</p>
    
    <p>Indeed, a hole about two meters wide was carved into the beak. Waiting for their companions to come tramping up, the Pepperhills stood in the shadows of long-tumbling clouds. For the first time this morning—perhaps the first time in his life—Kurobato noticed sand in his shoe.</p>
    
    <p>“Shall we head inside?” he proposed, as if it were perfectly natural.</p>
    
    <p>“Unthinkable!”</p>
    
    <p>Heavy footsteps announced Parkes. He and Segrin, round-eyed, wagged their heads from side to side.</p>
    
    <p>“How come?” said Sunako sweetly.</p>
    
    <p>“Such things aren’t for humans to explore,” Segrin answered with sudden roughness. “They’re past our understanding.”</p>
    
    <p>Uncharacteristically, Parkes agreed. “Yes, Sunako. Such things are to be respected—nay, revered!”</p>
    
    <p>“Don’t spout nonsense,” chided Kurobato. “It’s embarrassing.”</p>
    
    <p>But Parkes had come down with a devout sickness, and his rival, far from mocking it, caught it too.</p>
    
    <p>“Just so, Parkes. A fish that can live in this world must certainly be a god!”</p>
    
    <p>“Don’t think it’s alive,” quibbled Sunako, but the new believers didn’t hear.</p>
    
    <p>“The ultimate discovery—a Fish God!” Parkes exulted. “We must get back and tell everyone this joyous news.”</p>
    
    <p>“Yes, yes,” Segrin enthused. “Then we’ll go down in history after all!”</p>
    
    <p>“As headman!” both proclaimed at once.</p>
    
    <p>As three impressed adventurers clapped, the Pepperhills disappeared.</p>
    
    <div class="break"></div>
    
    <p class="first"><caps>“Think we’ll be</caps> digested, Kuro?”</p>
    
    <p>In the darkness of the giant mouth, Kurobato laughed gaily. “If we are, we won’t have to hunt cacti anymore.”</p>
    
    <p>A flash devoured the darkness. Five “Waaa”s drifted in from outside. Inside, the whole fish snapped into visibility.</p>
    
    <p>Kurobato didn’t know what the insides of an imaginary beast ought to look like, but this scene he couldn’t even have dreamed. In the middle was a wide space like the cafeteria, but the likeness ended there. Light poured from the ribs, spreading across the cavity to limn a pile of white rocks. Atop several of them stood, not shrubs or cacti, but actual trees! Huge, thick, leaf-covered trees. In place of ceiling, floor, and walls, the world inside the fish was bounded by a drawing of a sea of stars, curved into a tube. The queerest thing, to Kurobato, was the air—somehow cooler than the stuff outside. In the middle of the day, the temperature here felt like night. He and his sister gawked about. Today was full of firsts.</p>
    
    <p>“Aircon activated,” a voice confirmed.</p>
    
    <p>“Air… con?” parroted Sunako.</p>
    
    <p>A cheer from outside: “It speaks!”</p>
    
    <p>The strange voice continued. “You have one vidmail. Would you like to play it?”</p>
    
    <p>“Yes!” chirped Sunako, without a clue what that meant. A rock with no tree on it began to glow. Her brother’s hand flew to his scabbard, but his face floated up a smile.</p>
    
    <p>Above the rock a person popped into view. Not a real person, strictly speaking—though one seemed to be standing right in front of him, Kurobato felt no further presence—but amazingly realistic. A woman, maybe twenty-two or twenty-three. Kurobato knew at once she wasn’t of this world. Dark brown hair framed a white face never soaked in sun, flowed like precious water over delicate shoulders. The blue-on-white clothes draped from neck to ankle were like none Kurobato knew. Light trickled through her and her outline blurred a bit, but her deep blue eyes and largish nose were distinct.</p>
    
    <p>An angel, eaten by a fish. The phantom pulled on Kurobato like a sun on a planet. Sunako followed in his orbit.</p>
    
    <p>The angel’s lips parted.</p>
    
    <p>“You’re going swimming soon, Pisko. I want to go too, but you may have to go alone. Don’t worry, though, it’s downstream. The next leg’s upstream, so save up strength. The password is <em>open-air bath</em>. Do your best.”</p>
    
    <p>“What’s she talking about?” murmured Sunako.</p>
    
    <p>As they watched, a man appeared behind the woman. He wore the same strange clothes and was as transparent and blur-lined. His slender arms circled the woman’s waist, pressing her close.</p>
    
    <p>Kurobato’s eyes widened.</p>
    
    <p>“I’m sorry, Miss Aphiro,” the man whispered. In the next moment the woman’s eyes, staring into Kurobato’s, went wide as his. The cold whisper continued: “I just can’t have you using our Pisko as you please. Forgive me.”</p>
    
    <p>An arrow whooshed into the man’s head, then through it, leaving nary a mark. The clatter of Sunako’s dropped bow set Kurobato’s teeth on edge.</p>
    
    <p>With solemn fluidity, the man slid out his dagger from the woman’s side. Blood roared in Kurobato’s ears, drowning out his sister’s shriek. His drawn sword flashed in vain, slipped through, and fell. Cold sweat beaded on his dome.</p>
    
    <p>The body, propped by no one, crumpled quietly. Before the siblings, sundered from their weapons, the man wiped his on an elegant sleeve. He seemed to have just noticed something nearby.</p>
    
	<p>“Vidmail? Miss Aphiro, what were you up to?” 
    He swung his dagger, still half stained, and his image disappeared with his victim’s. Only the rock remained, clean and white.</p>
    
    <p>Above, the stars twinkled.</p>
    
    <p>As Sunako’s cheeks glittered with tears, her brother’s glowed with rage. Where had those odd-garbed people gone, the pretty one and the cold one? Had he really just witnessed murder? He didn’t especially believe in ghosts, but inside this fish he was prepared to believe anything.</p>
    
    <p>“Aphiro…”</p>
    
    <p>Despite the horror he’d just beheld, the name tasted good on his tongue.</p>
    
    <p>Sunako sniffled. “Kuro, let’s go home.”</p>
    
    <p>Flicking his hot gaze aside, Kurobato nodded. “Yeah.”</p>
    
    <p>They picked up their weapons in heavy silence and tottered out of the fish’s mouth.</p>
    
    <div class="break"></div>
    
    <p class="first"><caps>The next day</caps> Sunako didn’t go back to the fish. Her brother did, but on reaching it he was suprised to find half the townsfolk gathered there. Standing on a rock at the center of the crowd, Parkes and Segrin were chanting inanities.</p>
    
    <p>“Come, come and adore the Fish God! Pray for freedom from cacti and blessings of water!”</p>
    
    <p>Kurobato was gobsmacked. These votaries had never seen inside their god. For all their praising and chanting, none bothered to look. It was stupider than he could stand.</p>
    
    <p>“Whaddayou loonies think yer doin’? Leave off this so-called Fish God and get back to hunting cactus. Ain’t anyone thirsty?”</p>
    
    <p>As usual, no one listened. Seeing them pray to the glinting fish made Kurobato feel for the first time (today, too, promised to brim with firsts) that it would be all right if the townsfolk never got another drop.</p>
    
    <p>“Ask, too, for discernment in electing a headman!” Parks and Segrin jubilated.</p>
    
    <p>Making up his mind, Kurobato shoved through friends and neighbors to the center, and without a word strode into the fish’s mouth.</p>
    
    <p>A wave of loud surprise crashed at his back, but Kurobato’s spirits settled in the cooler air. It differed enough from the desert to raise goosebumps on his skin. Kurobato liked that fine.</p>
    
    <div class="break"></div>
    
    <p class="first"><caps>The stars</caps> at his feet reminded him of the stars above poor Aphiro’s body, and he spoke the words he’d been rehearsing since yesterday:</p>
    
    <p>“Open-air bath.”</p>
    
    <p>The same voice that had announced the aircon said, “You have one vidmail. Would you like to play it?”</p>
    
    <p>“Yes,” answered Kurobato, steeling himself. “But before that, would you mind closing the mouth? It’s noisy out there.”</p>
    
    <p>The fish obliged. The rapturous shouts died down. In the welcome silence, another treeless rock sent up an image of Aphiro, full of life. Kurobato’s pupils shrank to dots, then returned to normal. This phantom wasn’t happening now; it had been recorded, using something unknown to desert folk, and preserved. That much he could tell.</p>
    
    <p>The image captivated him.</p>
    
    <p>“Thank you for viewing my vidlog, whoever you are. I wish I could speak with you in person. Maybe I can, before all this is over. For now, let me introduce myself.</p>
    
    <p>“I am Aphiro Rumille, twenty-two years old, lead engineer of the top-secret Pisko Project. As you know by now, Pisko is the ship you’re standing in. Looks just like a real fish, doesn’t he? My team and I are very proud of him. We made Pisko for an important purpose. I don’t know whether it will succeed or fail. What does your world look like now?”</p>
    
    <p><em>What indeed</em>, shouted Kurobato in his head. <em>We have to kill huge thorn-covered cacti for a drop to drink. Fires crumble our houses every day. It’s always hot, hot, hot. And instead of doing anything about it, folks worship fish and wait for their kids to bring them water.</em> Kurobato didn’t want to show his world to Aphiro. It was embarrassing.</p>
    
    <p>Aphiro frosted the floor with her gaze. She looked about to cry, but Kurobato detected not a drop. Aphiro was the sort to hold her tears and try. Whatever the circumstances, it refreshed him to meet someone like that.</p>
    
    <p>“Our world faces a crisis,” she continued. “Science and technology were supposed to make our lives easier, but they altered the planet more than we can undo. Since we’ve depended so long on water as an energy source, it’s especially ominous to see it recede. Poseidon’s Curse, they call it, but I say we humans cursed ourselves.</p>
    
    <p>“Culpability aside, we’re too late. Our world can only go on drying.</p>
    
    <p>“I was scouted out of college by the Pisko Project. On the surface it was developing a research submarine, but really it was more last-ditch: a plan to save our world for real. I positively burned for it.”</p>
    
    <p>As she floated in the fish’s starlight, her own eyes twinkled ever brighter, and despite the aircon Kurobato felt himself burning too.</p>
    
    <p>“Before we could test him, though, our Pisko was suddenly cancelled. Someone had leaked the plan to the government, which pronounced it too dangerous. My work, my hope, my purpose in life were taken.”</p>
    
    <p>In that moment, if Kurobato had been ordered to slay ten thousand Cactus Kings for Aphiro’s sake, he would have obeyed without complaint.</p>
    
    <p>“Yet still I lived, and so did Pisko. Finding new purpose in that, I decided to abscond with him.” Her cheeks kindled in triumph. “Since no one understands Pisko as well as I do, I figured it would be simple. But just as my plan was starting to pick up, another Pisko Project engineer caught me.”</p>
    
    <p>A cold unconnected with the aircon coated Kurobato’s skin. His brain replayed the scene from yesterday, relived the awful aftermath.</p>
    
    <p>“His name is Melgoro Kan. My colleague both in college and on the project, sharp as they come. He made me tell him everything. And—isn’t it great?—he agreed to help! ‘Colleagues to the end,’ he swore, and we fled on Pisko together.”</p>
    
    <p>Without a doubt, this Melgoro was the murderer from the vidmail. But there was no way to warn poor Aphiro of that. Nothing could feel more powerless.</p>
    
    <p>“Yet even if Melgoro respects me, I can’t trust him,” Aphiro said.</p>
    
    <p>Kurobato blinked.</p>
    
    <p>“I don’t know where his loyalties lie. So I’m recording this vidlog—as insurance.”</p>
    
    <p>Insurance?</p>
    
    <p>“Thank you, truly, for hearing me out this far. Forgive my presumption, but I must ask a favor.”</p>
    
    <p><em>Anything</em>, thought Kurobato. Aphiro’s eyes sparkled.</p>
    
    <p>“If your world is dried, that means I’ve failed. In that case, please—for the world’s sake, mine, and yours, ride Pisko back to save me!”</p>
    
    <p>A light flashed on in Kurobato’s bald head. He finally grasped what this Fish God—Pisko—was for. From that knowledge sprouted fresh hope.</p>
    
    <p>Aphiro, alive in recorded form, smiled broadly at him. “If that’s a yes, you’ll need to say another password and follow some instructions. Start whenever you like. Pisko can wait. It’s a big decision, so please think it over carefully. The password this time is <em>cactus</em>. My hope is in your hands.”</p>
    
    <p>She vanished, leaving Kurobato alone.</p>
    
    <p>He lowered an eyebrow, rubbed his forehead, and smirked. Folks back then couldn’t have known about his day job, surely. Still—</p>
    
    <p>“Guess I’m licked. Cactus.”</p>
    
    <p>That instant, the stars all winked out and a moon shed faint light from Pisko’s back. The white rocks cracked and crumbled. From their dust wafted bubbles, dancing in a ring. A strange spectacle for a cactus hunter. The moon glowed brighter, and the bubbles popped. As a last act, the brilliant moon grew an hour hand and a minute hand.</p>
    
    <p>In the cool air under the moon-clock, gorgeous Aphiro winked back on.</p>
    
    <p>“You’re really going through with it? Amazing! …Or so I’d like to say. I don’t know if anyone will actually open this vidmail.” Her speech, presuming an imagined ally, lost some formality. “If you’re seeing this, things must be pretty dry for you. For us, too, but I can’t imagine what it’s like on your end. I’m really sorry my mission failed you. But don’t despair—you’re going to help me fix it.”</p>
    
    <p>The moonlight gloried in her hair.</p>
    
    <p>“But there’s one thing I need you to understand. If you really come back to my time, it’ll mean stamping yourself out.”</p>
    
    <p>The phrase pierced Kurobato like one of his sister’s arrows. Stamping himself out? Why in the world would—? Suddenly, her meaning bubbled up. History recorded that when Aphiro Rumille was killed, her plan to stop the drying died with her. Kurobato lived in the world that grew from that fact. If he rewrote history, his own birth would likely be prevented. Without that town in the desert, his parents would never meet. Nor would his grandparents. The more he thought, the clearer it became—even if he managed to save Aphiro and the world’s water, Kurobato would likely erase his own existence.</p>
    
	<p>And what about Sunako? She too would naturally fade from history. So would Parkes and Segrin and the rest. Their desert town would be replaced by another, all the people replaced by other people.</p>
    
    <p>Mass murder, one could call it.</p>
    
    <p>On the other hand, if he compared the births and deaths his trip would cause, the births surely prevailed. Souls beyond count, waiting behind history’s veil to be born into a world with life-endowing water. </p>
    
    <p>Everyone he’d ever known. Everyone he’d never known.</p>
    
    <p>Sunako.</p>
    
    <p>Aphiro.</p>
    
    <p>His own self.</p>
    
    <p>Even if he got them all loaded on his mental scale, he wouldn’t be able to decide. To Kurobato’s thinking, this problem went past humans’ power to solve. What was most important? He loved Sunako, for a fact. He felt sure he could come to love Aphiro, too; he was five-sixths of the way there already. The townsfolk (excluding Segrin and Parkes, of course) were important to him also. He could even see himself missing the cacti.</p>
    
    <p>On Kurobato’s scale, though, the world outweighed them all.</p>
    
    <p>Presently Aphiro spoke again. “If you’re serious about coming, say the word <em>ocean</em>. Pisko’s swum it before, so he knows the way.”</p>
    
    <p>Time traveler Kurobato closed his eyes and smiled. Another woolly word from the past. Still, it had a pleasant ring.</p>
    
    <p>“Ocean.”</p>
    
    <p>Aphiro winked out, and the moon-clock’s hands began to spin—slowly at first, but faster, faster, and faster yet, until they sketched a dazzling whirlpool. Kurobato felt Pisko begin to move, but it wasn’t anything in the air. His last thought in the present was that in every age, all over the world, the same moon lit the night sky.</p>

    <p class="first"><caps>“Kuro, Kuro!</caps> Don’t die!”</p>
	
    <p>He was fourteen, his sister five.</p>
	
    <p>“Ease up, Sunako. It’s just a prick.”</p>
    
    <p>“How are you smiling? Don’t it hurt?”</p>
    
    <p>“Nah. It’s just a little light wound.”</p>
    
    <p>“But it’s on your head! That’s dangerous!”</p>
    
    <p>“See for yourself, Sunako. It really is just a little piddling needle hole.”</p>
    
    <p>“But how can I see? There’s too much hair!”</p>
    
    <p>“<em>But</em> this, <em>but</em> that. Shall I shave my head, then? That way you can watch over it. I’ll go bald from now on, so stop worrying.”</p>
    
    <p>It was something to say, to cheer her up. But then he really did it, and when she saw,</p>
    
    <p>“You rule, Kuro!”</p>
    
    <div class="break"></div>
    
    <p class="first"><caps>When he came to, </caps>Kurobato felt himself riding in the same fish. Beside him was Aphiro—living, breathing, flesh-and-blood Aphiro!—talking to herself, suddenly aware of Melgoro Kan stalking up behind her. Fluidly unsheathing the sword that had come to slay the Cactus King, Kurobato leapt.</p>
    
    <p>“I won’t let you take her water!”</p>
    
    <p>Melgoro’s dagger thrust out, but the seasoned cactus hunter was quicker. With a groan, the elegant man collapsed to the floor.</p>
    
    <p>Despite having just seen a man killed in front of her, Aphiro seemed as cool as a glass of water. “Hello,” she said. “Your name?”</p>
    
    <p>“Kurobato Pepperhill,” her guest answered and pointed at Melgoro. “Sorry about—it couldn’t be helped—he—”</p>
    
	<p>“I know,” said Aphiro. “You did it for me, right?”
        “R-right.”</p>
    
    <p>A quiet moment settled over Pisko.</p>
    
    <p>“You really came. Thank you, Kurobato. I—I almost died there, didn’t I?” She lowered her head. “That’s cold, Melgoro. We were partners…”</p>
    
    <p>“Aphiro, on the vid-whatsit, he said he couldn’t have you using Pisko.”</p>
    
    <p>Her cold gaze washed onto Kurobato’s forehead. “Did he? I suppose I can believe Melgoro was prepared to kill me; he feared time travel that much. Even if he could stamp himself out.”</p>
    
    <p>Kurobato’s nods gave way to puzzlement. “What do you mean, ‘even if’? Isn’t that why he was afraid?”</p>
    
    <p>Aphiro puzzled a moment herself before smacking her palm in apparent understanding. “Right, right! I didn’t explain what I meant by <em>stamping out</em> in the vidlog. I’m sorry, Kurobato—it was cruel of me, but I felt on this mission I could only trust an ally who was ready to die for it. Otherwise, the one who came from the future might have been another Melgoro.”</p>
    
    <p>The sudden brightness of Pisko’s stars startled Kurobato. “I’ve been had, then?”</p>
    
    <p>Aphiro closed her eyes and shook her head. “No. Sorry. You couldn’t have known this, but <em>stamping out</em> is Pisko’s special power—an insurance against death by time paradox. As for what kind of insurance, think of it like this. The fact you’re here in this time depends on the fact you found Pisko in the desert. If we manage to stop the world becoming a desert, the fact you found Pisko will be erased.”</p>
    
    <p>“Sure, sure,” Kurobato agreed. “I find Pisko in the desert, now there is no desert. No desert, no finding Pisko there—and down we tumble into a logical hole. This stamp-out must be a way to pull us out of it.”</p>
    
    <p>“Exactly! By Pisko’s power”—her voice bloomed with pride—“as soon as you said the password, a copy Kurobato was printed on the record of time. Even if our actions here prevent your birth, that copy will act your part in history. It’ll be born and grow up in the desert, find the Pisko I sent there, disappear, and open a path to a new history.”</p>
    
    <p>Kurobato scratched his head. “Err… but you won’t send Pisko ahead in time now, will you, since I’m already here? And if you don’t send him, how’ll my copy find him?”</p>
    
    <p>At this complication Aphiro only laughed. “Of course there’s no need to send Pisko again. He’s a time-boat, not a tourist, so everything he does stays stamped on some time or other. Remarkable, isn’t he?”</p>
    
    <p>Kurobato wasn’t sure he understood, but he was content to be finally with lovely Aphiro. Together they would write a new future, where none but a single traitor had to die.</p>
    
    <p>“Well then, Aphiro, shall we get this mission going?”</p>
    
    <p>Aphiro smiled. “Wouldn’t you like a drink of water first?”</p>
    
    <p>She reached into the nearest white rock and pulled out two glasses in the shapes of cacti. The sight raised a globe of sweat on Kurobato’s forehead.</p>
    
    <p>“Why, why, why is it always cacti?”</p>
    
    <p>Aphiro chuckled. “You’re an odd bird, Kurobato. I’m glad to be saving the world with you.”</p>
    
    <p>After a long, deep, happy sigh, Kurobato Pepperhill sipped water from his cactus. It might be to soon to call this “love,” but there was time.</p>
    
    <div class="break"></div>
    
    <em><p>Dear Kuro,</p>
    
    <p>Where did you go? It’s annoying to have to tell you everything that’s going on in town. You won’t believe how the election turned out! Kuro, I’m the new headman! Since you disappeared, I’m the only one who’s been inside the Fish God, so I’m the only one folks bother with; Parkes and Segrin are wholly forgotten. It’s a little sad, really. I don’t know the first thing about being a headman, but I’m working hard.</p>
    
    <p>Don’t worry—even though I’m busy calling the shots, I still make time for daily cactus hunts. Soon I may be as good as you.</p>
    
    <p>I’m growing out my hair and tying it like yours. You’d love how pretty I am.</p>
    
    <p>I don’t know why the Fish God ate you. It closed its mouth, so no matter how I try I can’t get in. But I’m tucking this letter behind a scale, so I’ll have to trust it’ll find its way to you.</p>
    
    <p>It’s lonely without you. Come home soon.</p>
        
    <p>Sunako</p></em>
