    <h1>The Census-Taker</h1>
    <h2>Kendall Rice</h2>
    
  <div id="text">

      <p>A man with a clipboard appeared at our door</p>
      <p>To request that we let him inside:</p>
      <p>“The guv’ment needs tellin’ how many are dwellin’;</p>
      <p>I trust you’ve got no one to hide?”</p>
      <p>“We’re four,” said my dad, counting kids on his hand.</p>
      <p>Said the stranger, “I’ll see for myself.”</p>
      <p>He stomped in right past us (for there we’d amassed us)</p>
      <p>And muttered, “Two plates on a shelf.”</p>
      <p>The plates thus recorded, “a sofa” and more did</p>
      <p>The man with the clipboard proclaim:</p>
      <p>“One ottoman, tasteless; this doily a waste is,”</p>
      <p>But wrote he them down all the same.</p>
      <p>“Excuse me,” said Mom, “all the family is here.</p>
      <p>There are four of us. See?” And he cursed,</p>
      <p>For she’d made him lose track of the coats on the rack</p>
      <p>And he had to re-start from the first.</p>
      <p>“A table, four chairs, and a cushion for each”</p>
      <p>Was the sum of his work in the kitchen;</p>
      <p>My parents, presumin’ he’d come to count humans,</p>
      <p>Kept waiting to hear themselves mentioned</p>
      <p>Till finally my dad, full of civic concern,</p>
      <p>Interjected, “Sir, shouldn’t your notes</p>
      <p>Be an enumeration for representation?</p>
      <p>I don’t think my ottoman votes!”</p>
      <p>“No Ottoman’s voted since 1919—</p>
      <p>Or before, ’cept for maybe the sultan.</p>
      <p>You shoulda seen <em>his</em> tricks for drawin’ the districts!</p>
      <p>What good can such ’manderin’ result in?</p>
      <p>Thank God,” said the man, as he tallied our desks,</p>
      <p>And their lamps, and their bulbs, “for <em>our</em> system</p>
      <p>That tells us all fair our congressional share</p>
      <p>By our <em>muebles</em>, <em>si sólo</em> we list ’em!”</p>
      <p>Now why he spoke Spanish, I understood less</p>
      <p>Than I did this apportioning business,</p>
      <p>And why different factions assigned different fractions</p>
      <p>Of votes to a chair gave me dizziness.</p>
      <p>I feared for the fate of my beanbags, and balked</p>
      <p>When I saw how exactly he’d written ’em—</p>
      <p>“Boy, don’t be absurd; for Amendment the Third</p>
      <p>Says that no one is comin’ to sit in ’em.”</p>
      <p>And after he left, my father said, “Kids,</p>
      <p>That’s democracy, and you must learn it: your</p>
      <p>Legislators you choose; if they don’t share your views,</p>
      <p>They’ll at least reflect those of your furniture.”</p>
