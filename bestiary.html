  <h1>The North Square Bestiary</h1>
  <h2>Kendall Rice</h2>

      <p class="first"><span class="dropcap">T</span><caps>he watched pot</caps> never boils,” someone old and wise had told her once, and the girl by the window felt this was also true of a clock’s hands, though why anyone would boil clock hands was beyond her. She’d been staring past her reflection in the glass, through curtains of rain, at the lamppost clock on the corner for seven minutes now, if the clock was to be trusted, which she knew it wasn’t. It was a sneaky clock, and though it was old and pretty, like everything in North Square, she hated it, at least on Saturdays. She hated the hour hand for being slow, the minute hand for joining with the I’s and V’s confusingly, and the second hand for being absent, which wasn’t an option for her. Sometimes she pretended not to watch the clock, in case it boiled faster that way, but there was no fooling it. After a hundred years on that lamppost it knew how to make people wait. She stuck her tongue out at it and sank her chin into her hands to settle in for another seven minutes. But she didn’t time these motions very well and chomped on her tongue.</p>
      
      <p>When you were nine years old or waiting for Jacques St. Clair, seven minutes was an eternity. Ami was both, so she had to sit for two full eternities, eyes peeled for pointy orange hats, before one popped around the dark line of the lamppost. She held herself back until confirming there was a boy underneath it. Then she bounded from the room, black hair bobbing in her wake. She snatched a moment before a mirror in the hall to flick a rebel hair back into line and scampered off again, ducking into a closet for a small white umbrella before tearing through the front door into the wide, wet world.</p>
      
      <p>Pole Street glittered with rain-crumbs when Hurricane Ami swept down it, punching holes in puddles by the curb, streaking on unseen rails to the corner of Frost. Weather crashed like rockets around her, but the brave yellow chick on her umbrella kept her dry. Steam wafted from the pavement as ancient elms on each side of the street drank the health of those on the other. The hat bobbled, orangely and pointily, in the shrinking distance.</p>
      
      <p>Before its owner could protest, Ami’s arms were boa-constricting him, toppling the book-bag he’d been lugging. Mercifully, no book found the river that was snaking through the grass.</p>
      
      <p>“<caps><em>BON-JOOUUR</em>!</caps>” Ami hailed.</p>
	
      <p>“<em>Konnichi wa</em>, Bon Ami,” puffed Jacques St. Clair.</p>
          
      <p>The pale-faced clock tocked placidly.</p>
      
      <p>Jacques emancipated himself and scooped up the bag. He blinked, a scant eclipse of cloudy skies, and fumbled with his hat. Like the rest of his ensemble, it was soaked. Hadn’t looked like rain before his library run.</p>
      
      <p>“Find anything good?” Ami asked politely, ignoring the rain that pummeled his hat as she beamed beneath her umbrella.</p>
      
      <p>“Don’t I always?”</p>
      
	<p>Jacques made it three steps before his welcoming committee, seeing the welcome was over, was at his side and the umbrella over both of them.</p>
      
      <p>Most men with five years of education under their belts would gladly catch pneumonia before standing under an umbrella with a chick on it. Jacques St. Clair wasn’t most men. “Merci.” He took the handle by the bottom and walked on, managing the bag in his other hand. Staring forward, he answered her question properly: Elizabethan poems, <em>National Geographic</em>s… Ami strolled beside him, maintaining her grip on the umbrella just above his, and listened less to what he was saying than to how, till his tones melted into the plunk of rain-rockets overhead.</p>
      
      <p>When they’d retreated to the St. Clair study, toweled off, and demolished a batch of chocolate-chip cookies, Ami hopped to the mahogany desk where Jacques had left his library bag. Gold from an antique lamp incubated it like the egg it seemed, nestled in a heap of pens, papers, and empty mugs. She picked it up and shook. Down plopped <em>Twelfth Night</em>, <em>Journey to the Center of the Earth</em>, “The Cask of Amontillado,” something thinner whose title Ami didn’t see but under whose cover she slipped something from her pocket, <em>A Brief History of Time</em> (what on earth?), <em>Around the World in Eighty Days</em>, the <em>Odyssey</em>, and (“Wow!”) <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>. As the bag fell limp, Ami remembered it sagging from Jacques’s hand.</p>

      <p>“Hey, check out this one. I think you won something!”</p>
      
      <p>Jacques grasped the book she pointed at. Ami gulped. Had he seen?</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Incroyable</em>,” gasped Jacques, shaking out a notice. “You’re right! When did they start giving out encyclopedias?”</p>
      
      <p>He turned the notice in his fingers, examined it from several angles, and held it to the lamplight.</p>
      
      <p>“All I have to do…”</p>
      
      <p><em>Please. (It can’t be this easy.)</em></p>
      
      <p>“…is…”</p>
      
      <p><em>Pretty please. (Can it?)</em></p>
      
      <p>“…sign? Simple enough!” Jacques plucked a fountain pen from the nest and scribbled in a rectangle at the bottom.</p>
      
      <p>Squealing in triumph, Ami seized the notice and pulled it apart. Jacques didn’t blink as she thrust the two layers in his face. One promised a handsome <em>Encyclopædia Britannica</em> set to the undersigned, with a rectangular hole at the bottom. The other, scrawled in legally binding crayon, vowed immediate marriage to Ami Jordan in the crimson ink of Jacques St. Clair.</p>
      
      <p>“Thanks to the latest in sticker technology, I have you.” Ami sported her wickedest cartoon-villain grin. “Resistance is fertile.”</p>
      
      <p>Jacques was ruing the contract too hard to correct her.</p>
      
      <p>“You play dirty, Bon Ami; but a contract’s a contract.” When a second stare failed to incinerate the contract, “I guess we’d better shop for dresses and cakes and—ah, but what’s this?”</p>
      
      <p>Below the signature was a tiny note, not done in crayon: <span class="sc">see reverse for additional details.</span> On the back, Jacques’ cheery red pen: <span class="sc">disclaimer</span>: Any writing on the back of this contract renders said contract null and void.</p>
      
      <p>“Null and—void? But that means…”</p>
      
      <p>“…the wedding’s off,” said Jacques brightly. “<em>Désolé</em>. At least we hadn’t sent out invitations.”</p>
      
      <p>“How, <em>how</em>, <span class="caps">HOW?</span>”</p>
      
      <p>“Found it at your place the other day, when you were in the kitchen. Before you bought the sticker-maker,” he clarified. “And I said to myself, ‘Jacques, you can’t let her hook some <em>other</em> boy with this; she’s supposed to be saving herself for you!’ Thought you’d appreciate it.”</p>
      
      <p>Ami glowered at the contract, the boy, the signature. Her fist closed around the stupid thing. How could she have believed, even for a second, she’d outsmarted Jacques St. Clair?</p>
      
      <p>One day, though.</p>
      
      <p>The raindrops on the window slackened. A cheery bird in Jacques’s backyard had ventured a few notes but failed to coax a chorus from its bedraggled friends. Noting the soaked towels in a basket by the door, Ami thought that bird was asking a lot.</p>
      
      <p>“Funny you chose this book.”</p>
      
      <p>“Eh?”</p>
      
      <p>Stars gleamed in Jacques’s eyes as he raised the thin volume that had so nearly betrothed him. Bound in blue-stained leather and shut by a silver buckle, it looked expensive for a library loan. Perhaps embarrassed by its thinness, the publisher had stretched its width and height till it was big enough to stand on, though no one should try that near a bibliophile like Jacques.</p>
      
      <p>But something was wrong with it. Even at nine Ami had read enough books to know they all have titles. This one didn’t. Had the author forgotten to give it one? Then it came to her.</p>
      
      <p>“Is that a… journal?”</p>
      
      <p>“Close.” Jacques fiddled with the buckle. “At any rate, the writing’s been left to others.”</p>
      
      <p>The buckle loosened its bite from maybe thirty pages, all blank. Jacques regarded them hungrily.</p>
      
      <p>“Turns out the library’s running <em>two</em> contests with this book,” said the boy, sinking into the rolling desk chair like an executive about to make an important presentation. “I lost the first one on a technicality”—the colorful, crumpled contract lay on the floor, having missed the wastebasket—“but the second one, happily, is real.”</p>
      
      <p>The lamp’s eye trained on the leather book, making the other papers on the desk look dimly jealous.</p>
      
      <p>“They’re handing out these books at the library,” Jacques intoned, eyes twinkling, “but anybody who takes one has to fill it up and bring it back. Up to thirty-two pages on his or her favorite subject in school, to be judged on the first of August. The best book wins its author a—”</p>
      
      <p>“Pony?” ventured Ami.</p>
      
      <p>“Er, no, but still a good—”</p>
      
      <p>“A rocket ship?” Ami bounced like a sugar-rushed astronaut on the moon.</p>
      
      <p>“Actually more of a—”</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Super-romantic honeymoon in Paris</em>!” the little girl squealed in a saccharine storm.</p>
      
      <p>“No, no, no!” In his struggle for liberty, Jacque knocked over a paperweight and at least three mugs.</p>
      
      <p>“Ponies are <em>swell</em>, rocket ships are <em>magnifique</em>, and Paris is <em>lovely</em> this time of year; but nobody’s winning any of those things!”</p>
      
      <p>Ami crawled to the other side of the desk, looked him in the cloudy blue eye, and crooned, “What is the prize, then?”</p>
      
      <p>The lord of the study turned pink, as though bashful about the contents of his treasury. “It’s a—a classics collection for the winner’s school library. Quite, er, comprehensive. Suggested retail of—”</p>
      
      <p>Ami’s groan told exactly how that stacked up to a rocket ship full of Parisian ponies.</p>
      
      <p>“So it won’t fly you to the moon!” Jacques conceded.</p>
      
      <p>“But Frost Park’s library budget was sorely underfunded last year. They’re starved for stock, and this is a chance to score. They’ll print your name in all the books if you win, you know.”</p>
      
      <p>If the library’s budgie was starved, asked Ami, wouldn’t it be easier just to feed it?</p>
      
      <p>Jacques muttered something strained in French.</p>
      
      <p>“What’ll you write about, then?” said Ami.</p>
      
      <p>“I had a thought or two, but at this point I’m not”—it took her a second to appreciate his word choice—“<em>married</em> to anything.”</p>
      
      <p>But Ami spent this particular second investigating the last book in the bag. The cover teemed with… what were these? Some were unicorns, some serpents with spiked tails and feathered heads; but one was a two-headed pig, its other head taken from an orangutan, and one a fanged whale with bat wings, gliding serenely through a sea, or sky, or someplace stranger. For all these aberrations, the book did have a title, and that was <em>Bestiarie Fantastick</em>.</p>
      
      <p>“What’s a… beastie-airy?”</p>
      
      <p>“A bestiary,” said Jacques, looking pleased to have one, “is a book of pictures and stories of animals from the Middle Ages.”</p>
      
      <p>“Fables!” declared Ami, proud to show off her knowledge of the genre.</p>
      
      <p>“Sort of. Some do have lessons. But there’s one very important difference. Can you spot it?”</p>
      
      <p>Ami pried back the cover and leafed through pages of strange scenes framing scarcely legible text. If there was a lesson in here, it was lost on her, unless it was “Don’t mess with flying vampire whales.”</p>
      
      <p>“Well, Aesop never heard of <em>these</em> beasts,” she ventured, dropping the name as well as the <em>Bestiarie Fantastick</em>, which landed on top of the leather book. “Is that the difference?”</p>
      
      <p>“A difference,” Jacques admitted, “and important. What I mean’s that while Aesop’s fables deal in morality, bestiaries blend that with science.”</p>
      
      <p>Glancing from the vampire whale to the ape-headed pig, Ami doubted.</p>
      
      <p>“You’ll find a few normal animals in there, too,” chimed Professor St. Clair, now in full lecture mode. “That’s because medieval scholars wanted a record of the things that shared their world—what they looked like, how they acted, how their bodies worked, all of it. They wrote down what they knew and guessed the rest till it made sense to them. The less they knew, the more they guessed—and then they realized the guessing was part of the fun and felt no shame in passing it as fact. Just from the cover, I’d say a few of them had imaginations to rival yours, Bon Ami.”</p>
      
      <p>Ami was seventy percent sure this was a compliment. Compliments from Jacques were like money on the street, so she took it.</p>
      
      <p>The feather-headed snake beamed back in the lamp’s glow. Amid the bedlam of books and office supplies, it seemed serene. Ami dragged over a three-legged stool that she suspected M. St. Clair had filched from a Parisian pub, and the kids browsed the morals and mysteries of the <em>Bestiarie Fantastick</em>, gasping at some specimens, laughing at others, demolishing a second plate of Mme. St. Clair’s chocolate-chip cookies, ignoring minutes that stretched to hours, till the phone called Ami home to a dinner she’d quite spoiled.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>
      
      <p class="first"><caps>It ought</caps> to’ve felt stranger than it did, flying. Ami had never flown even in an airplane, which she didn’t regret when she saw what the whale she was riding did to airplanes. The pilots weren’t too bright, teasing a giant flying vampire whale. Bad idea—she’d read so in a book. Or maybe they just couldn’t escape in time. But shouldn’t an airplane be fast enough to? She couldn’t say. She could look away whenever the wind brought the din of fangs on steel, but outside of sporadic cetacean violence there wasn’t much to see up here—or down here; she hadn’t ruled out that this was an ocean, or even outer space. Now and then the blowhole blasted bubbles and scrap metal. Too, the big webby wings worked with the tail things, flukes, to keep the beast bobbing up. She fought the urge to sleep because a voice inside her (the whale’s?) warned her that would make things more confusing. She clutched the dorsal fin and waited.</p>
      
      <p>The next plane, like the last six, winged straight into its maw. But the plane after that was different. For one thing, it was a helicopter; for another, Jacques sat in the pilot’s chair. This, too, ought to’ve surprised her more.</p>
      
      <p>“Where you going?” she called, suspecting she already knew.</p>
	
      <p>“To our wedding!” he shouted over the whoosh of the blowhole and the chop-chop-chop of the rotors. “And <em>you’re</em> going the wrong way!”</p>
      
      <p>“It’s gonna eat you, y’know,” she warned. “Might wanna do something about that.”</p>
      
      <p>If this tiding disturbed him, he didn’t show it. The nearer the whale flapped, the wider he smiled. Finally, inches from ingestion, he lobbed a chocolate-chip cookie out the window. The whale lurched for it, nearly throwing Ami off. Jacques chucked another cookie, then another, and the greedy beast followed the cookie trail till the helicopter was a speck on the horizon. The speck hurling one more cookie at the whale—no, not a cookie, a book, headed for <em>her</em>, not the whale. She swiped, caught it by the buckle, saw it had no title…</p>
      
      <p>An explosion sounded yards up the whale, and the blowhole pumped out tons of steel, bubbles, chocolate chips, and white smoke—a cloud?—that rolled over the world. While she could still see, she scanned the book for a clue, but the pages were as blank as the cover.</p>
      
      <p>How was she supposed to find Jacques with <em>this</em>?</p>
      
      <p>Then came a bellow like a cannon, and just before the smoke swallowed everything, the whale wrenched its massive head backwards, and she got a look at its face: flat, round, white, a pair of hands chasing each other around a circle marked with Roman numerals. And fangs—but otherwise it looked old and pretty…</p>
      
      <p>After a scene like that, Ami was hardly surprised to wake up. The bars of blind-strained streetlight on the walls, though scary as always, meant she was lying in a warm bed on the second floor of a red brick house on Pole Street in North Square, and that was enough.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>

      <p class="first"><caps>During the night</caps> the dark clouds commuted to another town, so Sunday lived up to its name. One light-shaft found Ami’s window, snuck in through the same blinds the streetlight used, and settled on her nose with a soft burn too pleasant to sleep through. She took her time reviving. After much yawning, blinking, stretching, and twisting in the sheets, she sat up and took stock of things.</p>
      
      <p>She’d missed breakfast.</p>
      
      <p>She’d also forgotten her umbrella at Jacques’s. Hardly a bad thing.</p>
      
      <p>The whale wasn’t real. Real whales ate plankton with teeth made of hairbrushes and couldn’t fly, at least not in the air, which was good for many reasons. She’d seen what birds did to windshields and thought it best that nature stop there.</p>
      
      <p>Oh, and she was still single. Time to get to work on that.</p>
      
      <p>Not bothering to change out of pajamas, she padded downstairs to the kitchen and made toast. This needed a stool and a stretch, especially the orange marmalade at the far back of the fridge, but that came as naturally to Ami as anything. Since watched toasters too never boil, she checked what was cooking in the back of her brain.</p>
      
      <p>Sunday was when Jacques enjoyed the spoils of Saturday’s library raid. After months of crashing the event, Ami prided herself on knowing how many pounds of literature she could distract him from, even if the number spoke little of her. She also knew that if at least half of these pounds were in Jules Verne stories, nothing short of the moon crashing twenty thousand leagues into the center of the earth for eighty days could tear him from that study. Who could compete with that?</p>
      
      <p>Stupid Jules Verne. Jacques liked him because he was French and knew about things like cogs and steam. Try pointing out that he was also <em>completely wrong</em> about the future, and Jacques would just tell you that’s part of the charm. Ami was confident she could beat up Jules Verne if she caught him alone.</p>
      
      <p>The toaster dinged just as the light bulb went off in her head; she never heard it. Ripples on her mind’s surface said a marvelous idea had just bitten the hook she fished for schemes with. To see it, she’d have to reel it in.</p>
      
      <p><em>What, beat up Jules Verne?</em></p>
      
      <p>Not exactly, said the ripples. Not Jules, anyway. But you’re on the right track.</p>
      
      <p><em>The umbrella,</em> she thought, understanding.</p>
	
      <p>Bingo.</p>
      
      <p>Smiling to herself, Ami snatched the toast and reached for the telephone.</p>   
      
      <div class="break"></div>
      
      <p class="first"><caps>“Gooooot it!”</caps> she shouted when the doorbell rang six and a half minutes later, bounding downstairs in rope sandals and a cornflower sundress not designed for bounding. Her parents in the living room didn’t have to ask whom she was expecting. Just for fun, she peeked through the peephole, just for fun. A column of white swished under a triangle of orange.</p>
      
      <p><caps>“BON-JOOOUUUR!”</caps> she squealed, in case anyone in the neighborhood had missed it yesterday, and nearly hugged the hat right off his straw-colored hair.</p>
      
      <p>“K-Konnichi wa,” gasped Jacques, waving the white column uselessly about, “Bon Ami.”</p>
      
      <p>Fortunately for him, a big man in a terry-cloth robe and bushy red mustache appeared at the doorstep, grey eyes sparkling, to detach his daughter.</p>
      
      <p>“Nice to see you, Jacques!” He offered his hand and the boy shook it cordially, standing very straight.</p>
      
      <p>“And you’ve brought Ami’s umbrella,” said her mother, sweeping in beside her. “You’re such a gentleman, Jacques. We haven’t lost hope that your manners will rub off on Ami yet.”</p>
      
      <p>“Thank you, Mrs. Jordan,” answered Jacques politely, “but I wouldn’t hold my breath if I were you.”</p>
      
      <p>That was the magic of Jacques St. Clair: he could spend whole afternoons with imaginary people whose exchanges were scripted around such conversationally applicable topics as submersibles or ancient Sumeria, then hop back to a world of real people with real expectations and charm the pants off all of them. Ami had seen it work on parents, teachers, the librarian, even animals. It worked on Ami too, though it was only a speck on the tip of the iceberg of her affection for him. Somehow he’d managed to cheat the god that sells kids literacy for good looks and social skills. Could be the French in him.</p>
      
      <p>Considering this, she recalled accusing him of fancying Verne for the same reason and felt foolish.</p>
      
      <p>Jacques spared her parents a few minutes of living-room palaver, fielding their praises with repartee not even his slickest peers could emulate. This only encouraged them to keep him longer. Ami sat beside him on the silver-scarlet couch, pinching her dress around her knees, tugging on pillow tassels, contributing little. It was good her parents liked Jacques—that’d be important when he was their <em>official</em> son-in-law—but their fawning made her feel like the only kid at a cocktail party for grownups. She loathed this feeling but, sensing that complaints would make her look still younger to the titans in the room, focused on unraveling a tassel. Only after he promised to stay for lunch did Ami have Jacques to herself.</p>
      
      <p>“Thanks for bringing back my um-<em>brel</em>-la,” she sang, unholstering it from the fireplace rack. With two titans gone, the third shrank back to human size, recharging the battery in Ami’s chest.</p>
      
      <p>“No prob—hey!” cried Jacques, whose left wrist had lurched toward the kitchen in her grip, the rest of him chasing after. Ami felt him bounce behind her and laughed richly. Lamps and tiles rushed by, sun poured through frosted glass, sandals slapped the floor in rhythm with his pulse. She flung the sliding door aside, and out they vaulted into the summer.</p>
      
      <p>Ami’s garden was, per its proprietor, the loveliest place on Earth. It was commissioned a thousand years ago as the eighth wonder of the world. When the leading world-wonder critics published their review —“shames the other seven”—the slighted empires of the world declared war on North Square. An ancestor of Ami’s offered to hide the offending wonder behind a screen, that everyone might get to live. The world agreed, and the garden’s beauty flourished unseen till Ami Jordan toddled in. Her wave dissolved the wall of white, liberating the garden and re-inflicting its majesty on the world. Ami couldn’t remember where all this was recorded, but she could remember watching the sun chase the fog from her garden when she was barely old enough to walk, so the rest followed logically.</p>
      
      <p>The Jordans’ backyard wasn’t the biggest on the street; it was only the perfect size. From the kitchen door a stone path wandered through the grass, shaded by elm-branches and propped up by elm-roots. Two pools on either side of the path caught the sky, sometimes displaying it, today losing it in pea green and ashy grey. Frogs congregated there some summer nights to sing, bathe, or lay, depending on their mood. Away on the left a carved dolphin watered a birdbath from a hole in its head (her mind refused to call it a blowhole, like the steel-spewing smoke-vent in her dream); on the right, a porch swing that looked better here. All these rushed to Ami’s eye and fell away behind. Bees and butterflies, flitting down the track of violets and mums, tumbled over the edge of her vision.</p>
      
      <p>At last she towed her cargo to the koi pond. It surface was as smooth as a bathroom mirror, riffled only by falling petals or the occasional bubble from Jacques Carpier, the huge and stupid family fish. It was ringed by craggy boulderlets but for a reedy gap where path met pond. The stone under Ami’s sandals softened into wood bridge to Table Turtle Isle.</p>
      
      <p>This, of course, was the mossy mound that rose in the middle of the water like the shell of a turtle serving meals from its back. The island’s guardian, the willow tree that had wooed Ami’s mother into buying the house before they could really afford it, reached over much of the pond. Its name was Mr. Yanagi. Mrs. Jordan said that was a word, not a name, but Ami didn’t split such hairs.</p>
      
      <p>Her destination <em>du jour</em> was the rectangular stretch from bridge to tree. Lighting on the grass, she released Jacques and smiling at the sun through the weepy canopy. Her umbrella slipped from her right, and the sound it must’ve made when against the grass drowned in a dress-fluttering breeze.</p>
      
      <p>“See that, Jacques? The leaky light up there?” She spun in her sandals and declared, “Too nice a day to spend inside.”</p>
      
      <p>Jacques was already seated on a root, waving his hat at passing dragonflies. “Without beauty in the world,” he said, “there’d be no beauty in books. Humans are lucky to know both.”</p>
      
      <p>He clapped the hat down over a dragonfly, released it, and added, “Yet no one’s lucky enough to enjoy both at once.”</p>
      
      <p>“A book’s always there when you’re ready for it,” Ami countered, admitting a trace of indignation. “But tomorrow may be cloudy, or it may rain, or the willow may burn down, and you won’t see anything this pretty however you look up!”</p>
      
      <p>“True,” Jacques concede. “But the sun and the tree, assuming they live, don’t have to go back to the library in two weeks, do they?”</p>
      
      <p>“What is it with you?” Ami exploded. “How could you spoil such a perfect moment? I thought French boys were supposed to be romantic!”</p>
      
      <p>“I’m half French.”</p>
      
      <p>Ami squeezed her eyes shut and sighed. No use souring on him before lunch, considering what she had planned.</p>
      
      <p>“Grab that fishing pole, would you?”</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Pardon</em>?”</p>
      
      <p>“Other side of the tree,” she instructed, “beside the spider. Careful he doesn’t eat you.”</p>
      
      <p>Apparently accustomed to man-eating spiders as landmarks, Jacques rolled off the root.</p>
      
      <p>“Here it is. Bonjour, Monsieur Pest.”</p>
      
      <p>In truth, the Jordan family owned all their plot of Pole Street except Mr. Yanagi and a scrubby bush between his southern roots. These were the property of Mr. Pest, the garden spider who kept growing even though his web was always empty. Ami surmised it was for show and he actually subsisted on humans, the only prey that could support his two-inch girth. Because the only folks she knew who visited him remained uneaten, Ami allowed him his taste in meals and treated him like a friend. Once she’d even asked her parents if she might raise him in the house like a proper pet, but they had a policy against things with more than four legs. “Spiders are pests, not pets,” her mother insisted, so all that Ami, who figured pest must stand for “people-eating spider thing,” could give him was a fitting name. He must’ve thought that fair, for he never tried to eat her. But she made him a promise: “If I ever get tired of living, Mr. Pest, I’ll let you eat me, so one of us will be happy.”</p>
      
      <p>Jacques returned with the fishing pole, a four-foot children’s version.</p>
      
      <p>“What’s it for, catching that poor fellow?” he inquired, pointing the pole at Jacques Carpier, who’d snared himself in a lily. Ami shook her head.</p>
      
      <p>“It’s for today’s event!”</p>
      
      <p>She bent to retrieve her umbrella from the grass.</p>
      
      <p>“The reason you needed your umbrella on a sunny day?”</p>
      
      <p>“You <em>and</em> my umbrella,” Ami corrected. She held it out, raised it as high as she could, and whooshed it down.</p>
      
      <p>Jacques looked from her umbrella to his pole, his face turning as white as the former.</p>
      
      <p>“You’ve got to be kidding!”</p>
      
      <p>Ami kicked off her sandals—left, then right. Her left foot slid back several inches, skimming the grass before locking into place behind the right. She straightened, sucked in a breath, and leveled the umbrella at his throat.</p>
      
      <p>“Ami, that’s crazy!” Jacques scolded, tightening his grip on the pole. “You could hurt yourself, not to mention your fishing pole. Don’t you understand?”</p>
      
      <p>“No one’s gonna get hurt,” Ami assured. The umbrella never wavered. “This, dear Jacques, is a showdown for love!”</p>
      
      <p>A gust through the branches above rained blossoms dramatically, as if she’d blown it.</p>
      
      <p>“A duel,” continued Ami, brown eyes blazing, “between a prince and a samurai, with swords for hearts and hearts for swords! Fencing versus kendō!”</p>
      
      <p>“I don’t fence,” Jacques noted, as though that mattered.</p>
      
      <p>“’Course you do, it’s in your blood. I win, you marry me.”</p>
      
      <p>Jacques’s sigh rivaled the gust. “Figures. And if I win?”</p>
      
      <p>“Then,” Ami reasoned, “I guess you don’t. Shall we?”</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Non</em>.” Jacques drove his reel against the ground. “Too dangerous. Sorry.”</p>
      
      <p>Ami’s eyes narrowed. War-drums beat in her ears. “Don’t think of it as an engagement battle, then. Think of it as me kidnapping you and you fighting for your freedom if you don’t want to stay in my backyard he rest of your life without your silly books. Ready?”</p>
      
      <p>“I told you, I’m not—”</p>
      
      <p><caps>“<em>EN GUARDE</em>!”</caps></p>
      
      <p>She galloped at him between the branches, umbrella in attack position. Jacques had scant time to raise his pole before she was on him, aiming at his wrist: “<em>Kote</em>!”</p>
      
      <p>The pole’s fragile wood swung up so surely, Ami barely recognized the bookworm behind it. Could he have picked up fencing too, just by reading about it? She wouldn’t have believed it but from him. Banishing such thoughts, she sent her next cut at his torso: “<em>Dō</em>!”</p>
      
      <p>“This—is—not—a—sword!” grunted Jacques, absorbing the hit with the plastic reel. Ami gawked in sudden fear. On the parry’s momentum, the hook was flying toward her face! Jacques reeled it in just before it could land.</p>
      
      <p>Yikes. <em>Can’t turn back now, though.</em></p>
      
      <p>A month-old memory replayed—her first kendō lesson. She stood like this, feet just apart, and swung a shinai, the bamboo sword her mother trained with as a girl, in a line she hoped was straight. A bit longer and lighter than her umbrella, but the motions were much the same. Beside her rang her targets: <em>men</em>, the head; <em>kote</em>, the wrist; <em>dō</em>, the body. A blow to any could vanquish or disarm a samurai’s foe, and each was worth a point in his descendants’ sport. They were hard to hit, especially for a beginner. But her mother cheered her on, and Ami felt she could always win if it was love she fought for.</p>
      
      <p><em>Get ready, Jacques.</em></p>
      
      <p>She steadied her umbrella at her center. Her reluctant opponent batted it with his own weapon, hoping to distract her. His feet spread on a vertical line, and she supposed that, by knowledge or luck, he was doing something right. But one blow to the <em>men</em>, halted safely an inch from his hat, would force him to admit defeat—and engagement.</p>
      
      <p>Locked in a clash of hearts, wills, and kids’ accessories, bathed in Mr. Yanagi’s dappled light, Ami broke the stalemate and hoisted her umbrella behind her head.</p>
      
      <p>Showtime.</p>
      
      <p>With the sword of a samurai, heart of a maiden, and spirit of a goddess, Ami kicked off hard with her left foot, loosed a battle cry, brought down the instrument of her victory, landed heavily on her right foot, slipped, thumbed a button on the base of the umbrella in the shock of the fall, and sputtered as a bright yellow chick burst into being in front of Jacques’s nose. Then she hit the ground, and umbrella drifted over her head.</p>
      
      <p>With all that canvas in the way, she couldn’t tell what the rolling and tumbling were about, but the splash at the end told all.</p>
      
      <p>She couldn’t look. It would kill her to look.</p>
      
      <p>She looked.</p>
      
      <p>Jacques Carpier swam pointless circles around a baitless hook, waiting to see if anyone else would claim it. Ami’s eyes swam from the hook to the pole to the boy sitting dazed in the reeds, soaked for the second time this weekend.</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Touché</em>, Bon Ami,” he gurgled.</p>
      
<div class="break"></div>
      
      <p class="first"><caps>Jacques didn’t </caps>lunch with the Jordans that Sunday. Once the reason got out, the scolding ensued; but Ami hardly heard. A black wind was rustling at the corners of her mind. It whispered over happy memories, refrigerated smiles. She excused herself from dinner before finishing, but the black wind chased her up the stairs and into the bathtub, howling as she plunged her ears. Her thoughts took off.</p>
      
      <p>Her plan would’ve worked in a movie. She’d penned a great script, rounded up actors and props, and directed it as best she could; but the ending had sucked, frankly. She pulled her knees up under the water and blew hot bubbles between them. What had she forgotten?</p>
      
      <p>Table Turtle Isle was the perfect stage, but the grass was wet from yesterday’s rain—a mistake anyone could’ve made. <em>But you made it.</em></p>
      
      <p>Jacques St. Clair was the perfect male lead, but he’d never held a rapier—even though he was French. <em><caps>HALF</caps> French.</em></p>
      
      <p>The umbrella was the perfect prop, but it wasn’t meant for kendō—yet she’d looked so good wielding it on the Coming Soon poster. <em>You could’ve killed him.</em></p>
      
      <p>He was the perfect boy, but he wasn’t in love with her—</p>
      
      <p><em>Well, he’s not.</em></p>
      
      <p>She opened her eyes to the burning bath and cried. No sound came out, but the water got saltier.</p>
      
      <p>After she tucked herself into bed, a shaft of light appeared in her doorway. Another weight joined hers on the mattress. Ami was in no mood for interrogations, so she snapped her eyes shut and snored just a little too loudly to be convincing.</p>
      
      <p>“It’s not even your bedtime.” Her mother’s hand was on her forehead, and it didn’t feel angry. Grudgingly, she opened one eye.</p>
      
      <p>“Got sick of being awake,” she said and promptly shut it again.</p>
      
      <p>“I won’t keep you,” her mother answered in a voice that suggested she meant to do just that. “I only thought you might tell me why you behaved the way you did today. I’d like to hear your version of things.”</p>
      
      <p>Ami wriggled away and pulled the comforter up. She longed to explain herself, to persuade just one person that she wasn’t crazy, but she wasn’t sure of that herself. The black wind swept the words off her tongue.</p>
      
      <p>“Perhaps tomorrow, then,” said her mother, and Ami was alone again. She opened her eyes just wide enough to see a hand on the door and six slashes of streetlight on the wall. Both scared her.</p>
      
      <p>“My version?” she whimpered.</p>
      
      <p>A moment later the mattress bowed again. Amazing, how pleasant such a subtle shift could feel.</p>
      
      <p>“Yes?”</p>
      
      <p>Amid the bluster in her head, Ami wrestled her thoughts into line. It took some seconds before she felt confident enough to speak.</p>
      
      <p>“When I woke up this morning,” she began at last, “I was jealous of Jules Verne.”</p>
      
      <p>“Any particular reason?” her mother asked, as though Verne envy were a common complaint at the doctor’s office where she worked.</p>
      
      <p>“Jacques would rather spend Sundays with him than with me,” Ami explained, sorely aware of the way her bottom lip stuck out. “I hated him for that.”</p>
      
      <p>“Jacques or Jules?”</p>
      
      <p>“I don’t know,” said Ami. “Both, I guess. I mean—I don’t really hate Jacques, you know? I don’t really.”</p>
      
      <p>“So I suspected,” said her mother, clarifying the part in Ami’s hair. “You wanted to share something special with him, didn’t you?”</p>
      
      <p>“Yes?” tried Ami, fighting back tears. “I like swordfighting, especially under Mr. Yanagi, and I wanted Jacques to like it, too. But there’s—more to it. Jules Verne is French, and Jacques is sort of French, so Jacques likes Jules automatically. I’m <em>not</em> French, so I have to work harder to get his attention, you know?”</p>
      
      <p>The tears she’d struggled to fence in streamed like meteors down the sky of her cheek.</p>
      
      <p>“It’s not fair,” she huffed, burying herself in a soft shoulder, “but I do it! I’m willing to work, and plan, and pick myself up when things go wrong. I just thought this time I’d show him that—even though I’m different—”</p>
      
      <p>She broke off. The sky outside was clear, but the ones in Ami’s eyes were awash with falling stars.</p>
      
      <p>“You wanted to show him by beating him with kendō?”</p>
      
      <p>Suddenly aware of how foolish it sounded, Ami nodded sadly. To her surprise, she found herself in a tighter hug.</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Jakku wa Jakku de</em>,” rose a knowing whisper, “<em>Ami wa Ami na no. Jakku wa kono mama no Ami ga suki na no yo</em>.”</p>
      
      <p>The words floated over the howl in her head. <em>Jacques is Jacques, and Ami is Ami. And Jacques likes Ami just the way she is.</em> Lovely though it sounded, Ami found it hard to believe. How could her mother know what was in Jacques’s heart when Ami herself couldn’t see in there?</p>
      
      <p>Hands pushed back her shoulders. Her mother’s lips curved in a smile.</p>
      
      <p>“Culture links you two even as it marks you off,” they said, carefully shaping each word. “Jacques is no more Asian than you are European. But both of you are <em>American</em>, and each a precious thread in the fabric of this town. Look closer, Ami, and you’ll find the walls between you are lower than you think.”</p>
      
      <p>Ami thought of her father, a galumphing grizzly, and discerned a glimmer of truth in her mother’s words. But just a glimmer. This was easy for <em>her</em>.</p>
      
      <p>“Unfortunately,” her mother continued, “you’re going to have to live with those walls for another week while you think about what makes violence an unacceptable answer to any problem.”</p>
      
      <p>Right. Sigh. Ami’s stunt on Table Turtle Isle had earned her seven days’ imprisonment at 32 Pole, without visitation. No Jacques for a week. Yet even this bleak prospect vanished amid the worry brewing in her brain.</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Oyasumi-nasai</em>,” her mother whispered, kissing her last tears away with a Japanese goodnight. The door creaked open and closed, and Ami was alone once more with the light bars and the awful black wind. She couldn’t bear to think about both at once, so she focused on the bars.</p>
      
      <p>This fear she kept secret, for it had no basis in reason. Every night a picture haunted one of the walls around Ami’s bed and refused to disappear till morning. <em>Six Yellow Stripes</em>, a tasteless work of art no one had ordered but no one bothered to remove. Its painters were the blinds on the window, its medium the light from the streetlamps, its canvas the cream-colored wall. She viewed it as an intrusion on an otherwise peaceful darkness and hated to look at it for more than seconds at a time. But all she had to do to get it out of her head was roll over and face the other wall.</p>
      
      <p>This left her to her fears: new, potent, and all about Jacques. In one morning she’d distracted, kidnapped, assaulted, and drenched him, all to get him to the altar. He’d surely felt a lot of things on Table Turtle Isle. Yet not once had he raised his voice at her, not once swung his pole in attack. Indeed, he’d lowered his guard to save her from a scratch. Ami marveled at the courage that must’ve taken.</p>
      
      <p>Jacques St. Clair was one in a million.</p>
    
      <p>But he wasn’t in love with her.</p>
      
      <p>The stark truth settled like an anvil on the comforter. If her concept of love, the one she’d pieced together from her favorite books and movies and the way her parents acted around each other, was right, then Jacques wasn’t in it, and never would be, with her. She was his good friend, his Bon Ami, someone he endured because he was too noble not to.</p>
      
      <p><em>Itai.</em> It hurt.</p>
      
      <p>All the days she’d ignored the fact just made it heavier. Which was worse, faking a friendship or breaking a heart? She wondered if it was a choice Jacques had already made. Did sparing her feelings so dishonestly make him a bad person?</p>
      
      <p>No. It made him a wonderful person. So wonderful he’d give up Sundays to save her from whatever, even the truth. That made him a thorougher kind of hero than she could get her head around.</p>
      
      <p>Her head spun. Her stomach churned. This was the other side of love, the darker one no one had warned her about. To his credit, her father had advised her there’d be plenty of time for marriage once she graduated from school; but he’d been making fun of her, ignoring the real feelings that surged in her small chest. No one she knew thought nine-year-olds could fall in love.</p>
      
      <p>But no one thought ten-year-olds could read Shakespeare, solve quadratic equations, or name all the presidents of the United States, either.</p>
      
      <p>On some emotional level only she could see, Ami had fancied herself a kind of prodigy, like him. Now every heartbeat shouted that delusion down. <em>You know nothing, stupid child, chided the whale from her dream. Go to sleep.</em></p>
      
      <p>Powerless to argue with plane-eating dream-whales in her current state, Ami obeyed.</p>
      
      <p>The days that followed ran together like so many I’s and V’s around a clock face, and Ami was the minute hand, lost in the middle. Food didn’t taste like anything, not even macaroni and cheese; books weren’t fun, not even <em>James and the Giant Peach</em>; and television, even the anime network, was drab and samey. Life had lost its color.</p>
      
      <p>Her ears pricked up whenever the phone rang, but no hope lay there, either. Jacques never called, and even if he were to, his voice would never reach her.</p>
      
      <p>What if she never heard it again?</p>
      
      <p>That’s what worried Ami the most. She could be patient when she had to be. She could wait seven minutes by the window for Jacques to come home from the library, seven days in her room for her sentence to expire, seven lifetimes without him for an eighth with. But an indefinite stretch? All tunnel, no light?</p>
      
      <p>So desolate was this prospect that she got up early on Tuesday morning and paid a visit to Mr. Pest behind his tree on Table Turtle Isle. He was puttering around his web the way some folks putter around in gardens that look pretty but serve no useful purpose. Not a fly disturbed it, though Mr. Pest looked no worse for that. Ami reflected drearily that failed spider webs were the prettiest.</p>
      
      <em>“Hey.”</em>
      
      <p>The spider didn’t move. Perhaps he’d just eaten. He must swallow his victims whole, Ami realized, for there were never any bones or anything. Probably less painful that way.</p>
      
      <p>“Remember my promise? That if I ever got tired of living, you could eat me? Well, I have, and you can. So eat me.”</p>
      
      <p>This ought to’ve been exciting news for him, but the spider took it like a comment on the weather and kept puttering. Ami felt slightly affronted; this was pretty generous.</p>
      
      <p>“Go ahead. I’m tasty.”</p>
      
      <p>But Mr. Pest was having none of it. He worked steadily, showing his gorgeous back, acknowledging neither her offer nor her existence on the planet.</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Eat me</em>!” commanded Ami.</p>
      
      <p>Mr. Pest’s only response was to pump web from his spinnerets. Ami watched him weave, forgetting to blink, until the colors of his body ran together. When her eyelashes finally met, they stuck like spinnerets of her own.</p>
      
      <p>“Too good for me, are you?” she whispered and turned away, hair fluttering over her shoulders. A breeze too chilly for July sent willow branches swinging. Step by sluggish step, she trudged across the green, the bridge, the flowers, collapsing at last into the swing’s rickety weightlessness.</p>
      
      <p>The whole sky stretched before her, full of hot wet clouds that only blinks brought into focus. Her friends were dropping like flies, and there wasn’t a thing she could do about it. It was all she could bear to keep existing. She stayed on that swing, listening to the branches and watching the sky shake back and forth, back and forth, until she couldn’t see it at all.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>
      
      <p class="first"><caps>Ami lay</caps> on her stomach, on top of the comforter, in her room on Wednesday, kicking her legs to the beat of a J-pop song she didn’t really hear, when something small and red sailed through the open window, bounced, and rested on the carpet. She blinked. It didn’t disappear, so she rolled off the bed and went to investigate.</p>
      
      <p>A plastic party cup, red outside and white inside, submitted itself for her inspection. Tied to a paper clip inside, a piece of string ran through a hole in the bottom, along the floor, up the wall, and out the window to parts unknown. A voice inside the cup chattered up at her, a bit tinny but clear enough to understand. Ami nearly fell over when she realized whose it was.</p>
      
      <p>“St. Clair to Bon Ami, come in, Bon Ami, d’you read?”</p>
      
      <p>In that instant, everything was bright again. Scrambling over herself, she grabbed the cup with both hands and shouted, “<em>I read</em>! <em>I read</em>!”</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Shhh</em>. They’ll hear you,” warned the cup. It was made of plastic, but being also enchanted it probably knew what it was talking about. So she lowered her voice before addressing it again.</p>
      
      <p>“Is it really you, Jacques?”</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Oui</em>.”</p> 
      
      <p>Ami’s happiness knew no bounds.</p>
      
      <p>“Where’d you get the magic cup?”</p>
      
      <p>“Not magic—science. Sound travels through solids faster than through air, so when I talk into my cup, my voice travels up the string and into your room, where it bounces off the walls of your cup into a form your ears can…”</p>
      
      <p>Ami wasn’t listening to a word. Fingers clamping the windowsill, she tracked the string with her eyes, marveling at its length, until it plunged into the rosebush her mother kept in the front yard. Incredulous, she snatched the cup again.</p>
      
      <p>“Jacques, are you sitting in a rosebush?”</p>
      
      <p>“Er—yes, but—”</p>
      
      <p>“Roses have thorns!” Ami shouted, forgetting she wasn’t supposed to, as though it were a family secret he really ought to know.</p>
      
      <p>“I’ve noticed. But it’s OK. You’re grounded, so we can’t let your parents catch me, understand?”</p>
      
      <p>Ami pictured herself crouching in that bush, beating back thorns and talking into a plastic cup. Suddenly she felt like the luckiest girl in the world.</p>
      
      <p>“OK,” she whispered. Her heart hammered, thrilled with this forbidden conversation. But even forbidden conversations fizzle if no one talks, so she posed the cup a burning question.</p>
      
      <p>“Why’d you do all this, Jacques?”</p>
      
      <p>“Hmm,” the cup said thoughtfully. “You know those princesses in fairy tales? The ones some witch locks in a tower, so some gallant can show up and rescue them?”</p>
      
      <p>Ami thought her heart might hammer right out of her chest.</p>
      
      <p>“Well, I imagined how boring life must be for them before they get rescued,” the cup continued, “so I thought I’d see how this princess was doing. That, and I wanted to test the cup phone. How <em>are</em> you doing, princess?”</p>
      
      <p>Up in her tower, the princess squeezed her lashes shut above her cheek, and something cool and wonderful came sliding down.</p>
      
      <p>“I’m doing fine, Jacques,” she said, each word soaked with truth. “I’m doing just fine.”</p>
      
      <p>A single plastic cup had changed the situation completely. Today was Wednesday, July 13, and she ought to be spending it with him, not cooped in her tower listening to J-pop. Now that everything was possible again, her mind strapped on shoes and raced. Even as she bemoaned the tragedies of grounded life, she cast about for schemes, hoping to snag one that might hatch into the solution she needed: a way back to his side and into his heart. But Ami, ever ready with a plot, plan, device, or machination, was drawing a blank.</p>
      
      <p><em>A blank?</em></p>
      
      <p>She saw it again, drifting on the wind toward her outstretched hands: a book without a title, bound in blue-stained leather and shut by a silver buckle…</p>
      
      <p><em>How’m I supposed to find Jacques with this?</em></p>
      
      <p>Suddenly she knew.</p>
      
      <p>“Jacques,” she said sweetly into the cup, “have you started working on your book yet?”</p>
      
      <p>“For the contest? No, actually, why d’you ask?”</p>
      
      <p>A sigh of relief blasted the paper clip in Ami’s cup.</p>
      
      <p>“In that case,” said she, gazing into the rosebush, “may I help you write it?”</p>
      
      <p>Nervous seconds slipped by without any response. She raised the cup above her head and was about to shake it when</p>
      
      <p>“Didn’t see that coming,” the cup said, with as much sarcasm as Ami had ever encountered from a piece of talking plastic. “Sure, if you want. When can we start?”</p>
      
      <p>So happy was the princess in the tower that she sprang onto her bed, bounced, dropped the cup, fumbled it back up again, and inquired, “What’re you doing this afternoon?”</p>
      
      <p>“Pulling thorns out of my hair,” the cup answered earnestly. “After all, you’re still grounded, <em>non</em>?”</p>
      
      <p>Ami grinned a grin no one could see.</p>
      
      <p>“Leave that,” she said, “to me.”</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>
      
      <p class="first"><caps>“You’re saying</caps> I can promote literacy by lifting your punishment?”</p>
      
      <p>Her father stroked his beard thoughtfully as he perused the NSPL website. Ami hovered over his shoulder, showing him where to click for an image of the prize so he could see how comprehensive it was.</p>
      
      <p>“Please, Daddy, Frost Park needs this!” she insisted. “The library budgie was sorely underfunded last year, and it’s starving!”</p>
      
      <p>The big man roared with mirth. “And animal welfare at stake as well?”</p>
      
      <p>Ami hadn’t a clue what he meant, but no matter—this was so going to work.</p>
      
      <p>“I don’t want to go to a school without lots and lots of wonderful books,” she murmured, blinking at him with the biggest, brownest eyes she could produce. “You wouldn’t want me to, would you, Daddy?”</p>
      
      <p>Her father was struggling to handle her request as sternly as it ought to be handled, but the look on his face said very plainly that he would sooner die than send his daughter to a school without lots and lots of wonderful books.</p>
      
      <p>“I’m running this by your mother,” he warned, as though this somehow disguised that she’d already won. He disappeared into the kitchen for several minutes, during which Ami heard only snatches of his side of the conversation. She couldn’t be sure, but she thought she heard him say, “You wouldn’t want her to go through that, would you, Hinako?”</p>
      
      <p>When her father finally reappeared in his office to find Ami spinning in the squishy computer chair, his expression was exaggeratedly grim.</p>
      
      <p>“While it’s transparent you’re doing this for Jacques,” he said, “you have our permission to enter the contest—on one condition.”</p>
      
      <p>A smile floated under his mustache’s copper bristles.</p>
      
      <p>“You two had better win.”</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>
      
      <p class="first"><caps>“I’ve got</caps> to hand it to you, Bon Ami,” Jacques remarked, reaching for a cookie from his armchair. “I don’t know how you get away with this stuff.”</p>
      
      <p>As predicted, he plucked thorns from his shirt as he spoke, wriggling to reach the farthest ones. Ami tightened her lips around her cookie to keep from laughing. It was so sweet, the way he tugged without saying a word, as if to say he’d cheerfully spend a few minutes as a human pincushion if it eased her life. Warm thoughts and chocolate chips filled her head till she’d forgotten what she’d come to do.</p>
      
      <p>“So,” said Jacques, when the plate was empty save for crumbs and thorns, “any ideas?”</p>
      
      <p>“Ideas?”</p>
      
      <p>“For our book.”</p>
      
      <p>He jumped up, reached into the lampshade, and twisted the knob. Golden light lumped the leather book. It hadn’t been moved since Ami’s last visit. The ball was in her court; she couldn’t drop it now. Ideas were her specialty, and her mind was a magnet for them. In a flutter of eyelashes, she cast her gaze around the desk and went fishing.</p>
      
      <p><em>Principia Mathematica</em>. That wouldn’t do at all.</p>
      
      <p><em>The Time Machine</em>. Intriguing, but no.</p>
      
      <p><em>Romeo and Juliet</em>. Too—<em>gasp</em>—obvious!</p>
      
      <p>At last came a tug on the line. Between two matching Vernes nestled that menagerie of the bizarre, the <em>Bestiarie Fantastick</em>. No sooner had she glanced upon the curving gold letters on its spine than Ami felt her muse ignite.</p>
      
      <p>“Let’s make a bestiary,” she replied. “Of the things that share our world!”</p>
      
      <p>A moment passed in which the judges in Jacques’s unfathomable brain conferred and delivered their verdict: an impressed grin.</p>
      
      <p>“Not bad, Bon Ami!” He wrested the gold-lettered volume from the stack, turned on the overhead light, plopped down on the barstool by the desk, and leafed through the <em>Bestiarie</em> with an expression of increasing delight.</p>
      
      <p>“Favorite subject in school,” he murmured. “Of course, it’s science—tinged with history, literature, even art. Yes, it’s perfect!” Blue eyes flashing, he shut the book and turned to his partner.</p>
      
      <p>“With your imagination and my grasp of zoology, we’ll be unstoppable!”</p>
      
      <p>The brighter his excitement, the warmer Ami’s pride, till the lamplight looked rosier than this morning’s bush. Jacques reached into his pen cup and retrieved a favorite.</p>
      
      <p>“So begins,” he proclaimed, “the legendary tome of Ami Jordan and Jacques St. Clair: the <em>North Square Bestiary</em>!”</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>
      
      <p class="first"><caps>From that moment</caps> it was strictly business. An August 1 deadline gave them nineteen days. They lost no time kick-starting their publishing house.</p>
      
      <p>First they divided the labor. A good bestiary, as any medieval scholar could tell you, needs vibrant illustrations and lively prose. These the authors split between them, each responsible for sixteen graphics and sixteen pages of text. They’d conduct their research in the field, together or separately as circumstances allowed, producing two pages per day. Ami began to feel sure sure they’d go down as the prevailing artists of the age.</p>
      
      <p>While Ami brought spirit, vigor, and creativity to all her drawings, Jacques brought fine motor skills to his; so she gave him the title page, a decision she didn’t regret one bit when he pulled his pen from it. Big green letters wound ornately over leaves and vines, promising contents wild and wonderful. Jacques’s name—the same clear signature Ami had almost doomed him with—graced the bottom of the page, with space left above it.</p>
      
      <p>“That’s where your name goes.”</p>
      
      <p>She took the pen with hesitation, as though it were a magic wand, and endorsed the work she’d conceived. Standing over the book, staring at the names inscribed there, Ami felt she’d stepped into another world.</p>
      
      <p>Because page two was a left page, they left it blank to reserve its opposite for the table of contents, which at this point needed but two entries: “Title page” and “Table of contents.” Jacques beautified it with a border on the left side before calling it a day. The real work, Ami knew, was still ahead.</p>
      
      <p>She left that night with the <em>North Square Bestiary</em> and her first assignment. Brainstorming entries was no problem. North Square might not have much in the way of two-headed pigs or airborne, blood-sucking cetaceans, but the local fauna were interesting enough to win them the contest.</p>
      
      <p>In the bedtime darkness, before sleep took her, she envisioned one of her old favorite toys, a spinning wheel with pictures of animals around the inside and a handle that spun an arrow like a minute hand at a different animal each pull. The pictures had been typical barnyard fare, but tonight they depicted the creatures she saw every day. Her mind pulled the handle, and the arrow whirled around and around, landing on a bubbly yellow-and-black monster with a bunch of spindly legs.</p>
      
      <p>“The spider says…”</p>
      
      <p>But Ami never found out what the spider says. Her eyes were already closed, her chest rising and falling in, once again, the peace of sleep.</p>
      
      <p>When she pulled back the comforter at ten-thirty on Thursday morning, Ami knew she had their first entry. A quick call across Pole Street (she’d regained telephone privileges in the liberation) authorized her to give the bestiary its first illustration while her partner researched garden spiders. She took a box of crayons from her desk, shoved a black and a yellow in a pocket of her pink capris, and raced back down to Table Turtle Isle.</p>
      
      <p>“Hi again, Mr. Pest,” she greeted. “Sorry, can’t let you eat me after all. No hard feelings?”</p>
      
      <p>Mr. Pest wiggled his abdomen to indicate that, with six billion other humans on the planet, he’d find enough to eat. Another friendship repaired.</p>
      
      <p>“Mind if I draw you?” She pulled out her crayons and flopped down on the grass in front of his empty web. “I need to make Jacques fall for me, and maybe win some books for my school next month. Sound good?”</p>
      
      <p>The spider stopped wiggling and sat still as a statue, presumably that she might observe him better.</p>
      
      <p>“Thanks, Mr. Pest!”</p>
      
      <p>First she outlined of his belly in thick, fuzzy black. Above it she sketched a head like a snowman’s, only with eight eye-dots instead of two, and a large, fangy smile. The fangs made her giggle. Next she filled in the black half of the abdomen. This required a lot of looking up, and would’ve been impossible without a cooperative subject. Her progress slowed, Ami wondered if it would’ve made more sense to start with yellow. After a long time without blinking, she decided to heck with it and colored wherever, leaving random blank spots. Then she switched crayons and filled them in, careful not to sully yellow with black, and led three short lines off each side of the body. A final switch completed six long legs and added two short ones near the head.</p>
      
      <p>Ami blinked. Moisture returned to her eyes. She looked at the patient spider, then back at his likeness. It would do. The belly, she was pleased to see, had come out looking squishy.</p>
      
      <p>“You’re the best, Mr. Pest,” she whispered, rising to her knees. She would’ve liked to pat him on the head but, not knowing how, could sonly smile. This seemed to satisfy him; one last wiggle of his legs and he was off toward the bush, to wait for the next unlucky human to wander by.</p>
      
      <p>The bestiary had started strong. Clutching it to her chest as though afraid it might fly off, Ami marched inside for a glass of lemonade.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>
      
      <p class="first"><caps>“Bravo, Bon Ami!”</caps> cried Jacques that afternoon, brushing leaves off his hat. That was a hazard of holding a business meeting in a treehouse. The North Square Bestiary lay open on the floor where Ami was sitting with her arms around her knees. Flipping back a page, she found the table of contents expanded: “Page 3 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Golden argiope.”</p>
      
      <p>“What’s an argiope?” Her eyes narrowed. Something wasn’t right, and it was already in ink.</p>
      
      <p>“The proper name for a garden spider.” Jacques grinned at the picture on page three. “<em>Argiope aurantia</em>, scientists call—”</p>
      
      <p>“The proper name for <em>this garden spider</em>,” interrupted Ami, “is <em>Mr. Pest</em>.”</p>
      
      <p>A somber frown stole over his face, the frown her father wore to say something disillusioning.</p>
      
      <p>“About that.”</p>
      
      <p>“About <em>what</em>?”</p>
      
      <p>“About this <em>Mr.</em> Pest thing.”</p>
      
      <p>“What are you getting at?” demanded Ami, eager to get this project back on track.</p>
      
      <p>“How do I put this? Mr. Pest is… well, he’s a girl.”</p>
      
      <p>A gust from outside rattled a few of the tree’s higher branches, raining leaves on Ami.</p>
      
      <p>“Eh?”</p>
      
      <p>“I’d suspected for a while,” Jacques admitted. “Research confirmed it. The only argiopes that near that big are female. Everything about him—size, markings, living by himself—suggests he’s not a bloke. Sorry, Bon Ami.”</p>
      
      <p>True or not, it was a lot for a nine-year-old to take in. Ami felt one of her friends had betrayed her, and she couldn’t say which. She wanted to sulk, but she had to know, “He still eats people, though?”</p>
      
      <p>Jacques’s frown tightened like a string about to snap. He seemed unwilling to speak.</p>
      
      <p>“You’d better write that he eats people! I don’t care if he’s a girl, you’d better write that he eats people and his name is <em>Mr. Pest</em>!”</p>
      
      <p>“Don’t you think those details might make readers think we’re inconsis—”</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Write it</em>!”</p>
      
      <p>Her heart pounded, her head hurt, her breaths came short and hot. This bestiary was <em>her</em> idea, and here Jacques was taking over the very first entry! Well, not on her watch. It was time she exerted some editorial control—</p>
      
      <p><em>Idiot.</em></p>
      
      <p>What?</p>
      
      <p><em>You’re an idiot. So what if this was your idea? Have you forgotten why you’re doing it in the first place?</em></p>
      
      <p>Stricken, she stared at her friend as though seeing him for the first time. His cloudy eyes looked a century old. His freckles told his true age, though, and under them shone his cheery smile, a candle that seldom went out. Most days that smile was Ami’s ticket to cloud nine. Just now, it made her feel petulant.</p>
      
      <p>“Please?” was the all she could think to say. At least she said it nicely.</p>
      
      <p>Jacques put his pen to page three. Ami rested her chin on folded hands and watched him work, listening to the whistle of the wind and the silence of her heartbeat.</p>
      
      <p>The pen-cap clicked her to attention. Page three was finished, like it or not. With a courteous nod Jacques submitted the result:</p>
      
      <p><em>“Meet Mr. Pest, one of North Square’s most formidable arachnids. Sprawling fifty-one millimeters from fang to spinneret, Mr. Pest is the largest golden garden spider (Argiope aurantia) this side of science fiction. Despite the name, Mr. Pest is actually a female; males of the species are smaller, plainer, and skinnier than this fairest of orb-weavers. While most argiopes restrict themselves to an arthropod-only menu, this one has been rumored to dine on human flesh; the spider’s name has been confirmed as an acronym for ‘people-eating spider thing.’ Whether or not this is a coincidence, visitors are advised to watch for webs.”</em></p>
      
      <p>Before she knew what she was doing, Ami’s arms were around his middle. Things like this made her think she could put up with him after all.</p>
      
      <p>They knocked out half their daily quota before noon—a good omen. Lunchtime was upon them. Ami’s father liked to do his part for the cause—it distracted him from the article he was grappling with—so the kids munched grilled-cheese sandwiches with pickles at the kitchen counter. Before she’d started her second, Ami suggested they do Jacques for their next entry.</p>
      
      <p>“You want—to put—<em>me</em> in the Bestiary?” said the boy between bites.</p>
      
      <p>Ami shook her head. “No, silly, the other Jacques. The stupid one.” When that rang no bells, she spelled it out: “Jacques Carpier!”</p>
      
      <p>Back to Table Turtle Isle, then, for the next round. How they’d get their subject to stop swimming long enough to sit for a portrait was beyond Ami, who preferred still-lifes.</p>
      
      <p>“How ’bout you take this one, partner?”</p>
      
      <p>Jacques nodded and stared thoughtfully at the water, tracking the hyperkinetic carp. He scooped up some fallen willow leaves, rolled them into a ball, and chucked it into the pond. Jacques Carpier rushed to the surface to investigate the divine gift, particularly its edibility.</p>
      
      <p>“There’s a good boy!” Jacques unbuckled the Bestiary.</p>
      
      <p>Why hadn’t Ami thought of that?</p>
      
      <p>But not even Jacques’s tactics could wow her like his drawing could. From the way he sat, balancing the book on his knees, to his grip on his pencil, guiding but not presuming to tame it, he exuded confidence. Striking outlines, shading scales, that pencil scratched till Carpier himself smiled vacantly from the page, crimson splotches and silver whiskers somehow caught in black and white.</p>
      
      <p>“Over to you, Bon Ami.”</p>
      
      <p>In her mortal hands the <em>Bestiary</em> felt heavier.</p>
      
      <p>Rocking beside him on the swing, she opening it. Jacques slipped her the green pen, flipped his cap into his lap, tipped his head back over the edge of the swing, and closed his eyes. Cicadas buzzed from hidden garrisons in the yard. For a time, Ami watched him breathe and dangled the uncapped pen above the paper. When she looked down, Jacques Carpier grinned back so convincingly she forgot there wasn’t a pond between them.</p>
      
      <p>The pen in her fingers felt alive, thirsty.</p>
      
      <p><em>Better not mess up.</em></p>
      
      <p>She lowered point to paper and began.</p>
      
      <p><em>“Next door to Mr. Pest lives Jacques Carpier, a big carp who’s always happy. He moved to North Square from Japan when he was little and has lowered the intelligence of the pond ever since. His curiosity gets him in trouble, but nothing he can’t handle. He thinks he owns the pond, but doesn’t brag or anything. Carps with white bodies and red splotches on their backs like his are called Kohaku, but Jacques doesn’t know that ’cause no one ever told him. He also doesn’t know he’s named after Jacques Cartier, a French explorer who liked traveling around in the water as much as he does. For all he doesn’t know, Jacques is a very sweet carp. His charm brings color to grey days.”</em></p>
      
      <p>Her style didn’t sparkle like her partner’s, but it did the job. After re-reading twice, Ami added a sentence: “If anyone wants to know, his scientific name is              .” She could write it in later. “Odds are he doesn’t know that, either.”</p>
      
      <p>That ought to make Jacques happy. St. Clair, that is.</p>
      
      <p>Light snores had joined the insects’ buzz. Jacques’s statue hands laced over his hat. Did he ever wash that hat? Surely, considering how much outside he exposed it to. How then did it stay so orange? A special bleach?</p>
      
      <p>“Hey.” She poked his shoulder with the pen cap. “Wake up. I got a question.” No answer. She poked him harder.</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Cinq minutes</em>…” Snore.</p>
      
      <p>Jab. Snort.</p>
      
      <p>“What’s the scientific name for the common carp?”</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Cyprinus carpio</em>,” Jacques murmured.</p>
      
      <p>Ami filled in the gap and closed the book on day two. Jacques’s chest went up and down, up and down. She scanned the garden to make sure no one was watching, pulled his hat up, and laid her head on his lap. Then she dropped the hat on her own head and fell asleep herself.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>
      
      <p class="first"><caps>The <em>Bestiary</em></caps> marched on. Production continued two-a-day, foiled by Ami’s dental appointment on Monday but resumed on a grueling three-page Tuesday. Jacques stepped up as managing editor, lending his desk, his optimism, even his Sundays. He meant to finish on July 28, leaving three days to complete the table of contents and tend to any post-production mishaps.</p>
      
      <p>Ami’s contribution was originality. The ease with which she brainstormed new entries let them spend time on nittier, grittier tasks. She didn’t believe in writer’s block and refused to hear it as an excuse.</p>
      
      <p>Her attention span, challenged by half-hour cartoons, did struggle with the sustained project. But the <em>Bestiary</em>’s fascination that buoyed her over her impatience. Maybe it was wrestling her fleeting impressions onto the permanent page. Maybe it was sharing her world with the one outside, or finding a voice, or painting her subjects with fresh coats of affection. Maybe it was just afternoons with Jacques St. Clair.</p>
      
      <p>Or maybe not. She did things <em>with</em> Jacques all the time—pigeon-chasing, laps around a pool—but this was different. She was doing this <em>for</em> Jacques, and every day with it was the best of the summer.</p>
      
      <p>The table of contents swelled with their stable of creatures. It came to include, beyond Mr. Pest the lady argiope and Jacques Carpier the Kohaku koi, a bullfrog in Ami’s garden (<em>“Slimy, otherwise nice”</em>), a randomly chosen Frost Park pigeon (“<em>Dirtier than it looks</em>”), a salamander Ami depicted breathing fire over Jacques’s concerns, Mr. Yanagi (“Trees are creatures, too!”), the ghosts that haunted certain shelves at NSPL (“Sacre bleu”), and a menagerie of other colorful fauna, with a few flora for diversity.</p>
      
      <p>At first, Jacques protested the flora. A bestiary  being a “book of beasts,” etymology barred willows and their kind. Ami argued that trees were <em>alive</em>, had a <em>spirit</em>, Mr. Yanagi’d warded her garden for <em>centuries</em>, and Jacques was the most insensitive Frenchman she’d ever met. Jacques muttered he could live with that but backed down, and the willow made it in. One less cause to weep.</p>
      
      <p>Ami’s liberties niggled at her left-brained counterpart. She focused on the bullfrog’s musicality over its anatomy, physiology, and courtship habits. She credited its growth from a tadpole to amphibian magic so complex it needed a year and gallons of water to cast. Science had confirmed a conflicting theory and closed the door on debate, but Ami found that unworthy a bestiary. But when she claimed that salamanders cough flames, ghosts haunt only scary books and those most lately overdue, and squirrels store their food in cheeks linked to other dimensions, Jacques put his foot down.</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Désolé</em>, Bon Ami, but this has gone far enough!” he announced one evening in late July. “If you don’t rein in that fantasy, this book is going to sink.”</p>
      
      <p>The cookie stopped en route to Ami’s mouth. It trembled, slipped, and fell to the carpet. Lightning flashed in the picture window, and five seconds later a thunderclap rocked the study. The cookie, obeying universal time-lapse standards, expired.</p>
      
      <p>“What’re you saying?”</p>
      
      <p>Raindrops pummeled the glass. Within these warm walls, a different storm was rising in a boy who never stormed.</p>
      
      <p>“Let’s have a look.” His eyes flashed as he threw back the cover and paged through with none of his usual reverence. “Let’s meet the creatures that share our town with us. Phantasms! Talking trees! <em>Multidimensional rodents</em>! Ami, this isn’t a fiction contest!”</p>
      
      <p>Lava welled in Ami’s eyes. Jacques St. Clair had called her by her name. Pronounced it “AY-mee,” the American way, and prefixed it with no endearment. She’d dreamed about this day, when Jacques would drop the “Bon” that marked them as friends, even best friends but no more, and in dreams it didn’t go like this. There he’d call her “Ah-mee,” sometimes “belle Ami” or “ma chérie”—not ever like this.</p>
      
      <p>“You’re one to talk!” she roared. If she couldn’t win his heart, she’d at least win the argument. “Hijacking my bestiary to cram it with crummy facts no one cares about! Or have you forgotten what one looks like?”</p>
      
      <p>She grabbed Jacques’s borrowed <em>Bestiarie Fantastick</em> and thrust it in his face.</p>
      
      <p>“A bestiary,” Jacques began, each word dropping like an anvil, “is a book of pictures and stories of animals from the Middle Ages. Medieval scholars wanted a record of the things that shared their world—<em>what they looked like</em>, <em>how they acted</em>, <em>how their bodies worked</em>, <caps>all of it</caps>.”</p>
      
      <p>“They wrote down what they knew,” Ami retorted— two could play this—“and guessed the rest till it made sense to them!”</p>
      
      <p>“We don’t have to guess, ’cause we aren’t medieval scholars! We know tadpoles grow through metamorphosis, not sorcery; we know salamanders breathe air through their skin, not fire through their mouths; and we know how far a squirrel’s cheeks can stretch before they burst!”</p>
      
      <p>“<caps>How far</caps>?” demanded Ami.</p>
      
      <p>“Someone can measure it, <caps>ok</caps>? The important thing is those scholars didn’t know. If they’d written their bestiaries knowing what we know today, they’d have been <em>lying</em>, not guessing!”</p>
      
      <p>“They saw that guessing was part of the fun, Jacques. Why can’t you?”</p>
      
      <p>“And what if someone picks up our book in a hundred years expecting accurate descriptions of the creatures in our town?”</p>
      
      <p>“That’s what textbooks are for!” thundered Ami, seizing the <em>North Square Bestiary</em> and chucking it across the room.</p>
      
      <p>The clock struck seven. Ami’s earth split in two.</p>
      
      <p>The rain’s gloomy hammer on the window was the loudest sound she’d ever heard. Jacques said less than nothing. He strode across the room to the site of the crash. Ami expected he’d find a crater there. He dropped to one knee, lifted the casualty, brushed it off—and spoke.</p>
      
      <p>“Good thing I closed the buckle.”</p>
      
      <p>From another world he came to her and clapped a hand on her shoulder. She recognized that world as her own; only she had left it.</p>
      
      <p>“It’s all right, Bon Ami.” His voice warmed like hot chocolate. “We got so wrapped up, we forgot what day it is.”</p>
      
      <p><em>What day—?</em></p>
      
      <p>Jacques pointed to a desktop calendar, the kind you have to pull a page off every day. Today’s page showed the date in big, bold numbers: JULY 28, 2005.</p>
      
      <p>Ami gazed incredulously from the beaming boy to the book in his hands. It was intact, and better yet it was</p>
      
      <p><em>Finished.</em></p>
      
      <p>She pinched her arm. Not a dream. The <em>Bestiary</em> was finished on schedule, solid as the desk. She’d sunk so deep in the daily rhythm of graphic, text, graphic, text, she hadn’t noticed the page she’d scrawled on this afternoon was the last before the back cover!</p>
      
      <p>Their magnum opus was finished.</p>
      
      <p>Forgetting the past, she wrapped Jacques in the biggest, tightest, beariest hug she’d ever inflicted, and this time he hugged her back.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>

      <p class="first"><caps>Next morning</caps> Ami awoke feeling buoyant. The feeling only heightened as she remembered why, and now had to decide what to do with it. She could call Jacques and flirt, flinging mutual congratulations till his dormant passion woke and he professed undying love. Or she could make some toast.</p>
      
      <p>Really it depended on whether they had marmalade. Yawning majestically, she rolled out of bed and went to scope out the refrigerator situation.</p>
      
      <p>Halfway down the stairs, she realized this wasn’t her house.</p>
      
      <p>Or anybody’s—at least not anybody real. This was a cartoon house, a house of fiction, a house that couldn’t exist in any dimension Ami knew. Had she awoken in the parallel universe where squirrels keep winter stock? There wasn’t an acorn in sight.</p>
      
      <p>Where was she, then?</p>
      
      <p>It <em>resembled</em> her house, come to think of it: the rooms were where they ought to be. But where walls came together, encountered ceilings or floors, the resemblance broke down. The straight, colorless edges that marked these places had become fuzzy black lines that vibrated. The walls were painted in splotchy pastels. The house looked like one she’d drawn for the refrigerator as a toddler.</p>
      
      <p>Eh?</p>
      
      <p>To her relief, her arms and legs were solid. Whatever had happened around her, it happened to her yet.</p>
      
      <p>Had it happened to her parents?</p>
      
      <p>Her mother had likely left for work, but her father might still be around. Calling him, Ami crossed the cartoon kitchen, noting 2D pots and pans, to the office where he wrote in the mornings. It was there, but empty.</p>
      
      <p>Now that she knew she was alone and that the refrigerator had no marmalade her 3D stomach could digest, she noticed other things. Every few seconds, the black lines and vivid colors would turn graphite grey and back. This strengthened the feeling of walking inside an artwork, or juggled between two.</p>
      
      <p>She tiptoed across the plane of the living room floor, sank onto the couch with spiny squares in place of tasseled pillows, and sighed.</p>
      
      <p>Now what?</p>
      
      <p>Should she go insane? Maybe as a last resort. Wanting a better option, she closed her eyes, prayed the ideas would be biting today, and cast.</p>
      
      <p>Almost at once, Jacques bit. If anyone knew what was going on, he would.</p>
      
      <p>Brushing the pillow hair from her eyes, she walked outside, leaving the one-line deadbolt unlocked, and made for 45 Pole.</p>
      
      <p>Outside was as strange as in-. Not a car was on the road. Ami understood; she wouldn’t feel comfortable driving around a town that looked like this, even if she were old enough and knew how. The sky itself flashed baby blue one moment and shady white the next. The wind blew around her in visible, parallel curves she could reach out and touch and feel only coolness.</p>
      
      <p>Jacques stood on the porch between columns of solid white, pointy hat perched on his straw-colored head. He looked tired but glad to see her.</p>
      
      <p>“Bonjour.”</p>
      
      <p>“Konnichi wa, Bon Ami.” His sky-blue eyes fixed on a sky that wasn’t, at the moment, and his frown mixed thoughtful with grim.</p>
      
      <p>“You’ve noticed the way the lines and colors shift?”</p>
      
      <p>“From crayons to pencils,” Ami affirmed, tugging at the drawstring of her pajama pants.</p>
      
      <p>“I wish I could say what it means,” said Jacques. The sprinkler system in his yard pumped rings of blue that lengthened to light grey rods before hitting the warping lawn.</p>

      <p>“Your parents?” Ami ventured.</p>
      
      <p>“Gone.”</p>
      
      <p>“Mine too.”</p>
      
      <p>A moment passed. “Oh, Jacques, are we really alone?”</p>
      
      <p>“That’s the thing, Bon Ami: neither of us is. Maybe just our parents were pulled out of this world; more likely everyone else was. Yet here we are.”</p>
      
      <p>“We could be the only two people left in the entire world?” Too frightening a thought to entertain for long.</p>
      
      <p>“If so—if we’re really just two—this world must not have been created around either of us as a focal point. In that case only one of us would be here. Since we both are, this world must’ve been built around <em>both</em> of us.”</p>
      
      <p>Whoever built it, Ami decided, had a twisted design sense.</p>
      
      <p>“Let’s test your theory. See if we really are the only ones in town.”</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Oui</em>.” Jacques pulled his cap over his ears before another visible wind curved into his face. “Let’s get to it.”</p>
      
      <p>It was a credit to Jacques as a scientist that he stayed so flexible even as his precious natural laws were mocked. His science rested not on faith but on inquiry, and he could tweak his precepts if his senses proved them obsolete.</p>
      
      <p>“All we can say for sure right now,” he said, heading east toward Frost, “is that this is definitely North Square.”</p>
      
      <p>Everywhere Ami looked, the houses were old and pretty, if grizzled-old and pastel-pretty. On the corner stood the lamppost clock that used to torment her on Saturdays, before she’d entered publishing. Scarcely more than a pair of circles on a stick, it preserved the original’s charm—and function. Nine-forty, it read.</p>
      
      <p>They came to Ami’s house, the family Honda solid green in the driveway. Her mother’s roses, black and greasy, glimmered from the bush. As they blossomed into splendid pink, Ami spied something long and white snaking through the grass and up the front of her house.</p>
      
      <p>“Look!” she cried, jogging to the rosebush. A yank on the white line brought a red cup. “It’s still here!”</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Inconcevable</em>.” The world went grey again, and the cup vanished from Ami’s hands, string and all.</p>
      
      <p>“It was here,” she insisted, “the phone-cup, it was here.” Indeed, as color crept back into the air, she thought she felt its weight on her palm.</p>
      
      <p>Jacques shook his head, and all was black and white again.</p>
      
      <p>“I moved it. I took it home the day we started the Bestiary.”</p>
      
      <p>“Jacques,” asked Ami suddenly, “where is it?”</p>
      
      <p>“What, the cup? I stashed it in my wardrobe—top shelf, I think.”</p>
      
      <p>“No, the <em>Bestiary</em>! Where’s the <em>Bestiary</em>?”</p>
      
      <p>Facing the street, Jacques thought it over. “Didn’t you have it?”</p>
      
      <p>“That’s right.” The recollection flushed the pencil strokes around her with blooms of color. “I brought it home and put it on the nightstand by my bed. That’s where it is.”</p>
      
      <p>“We should check on it.”</p>
      
      <p>She led him inside and told him to wait in the living room. The planes of walls and floors, she noticed on the stairs, were keeping color for longer periods. She preferred this crayonned mode to the leaden other one. Charging into the door on her left, she gasped.</p>
      
      <p>No <em>Bestiary</em>.</p>
      
      <p>She tromped up and down the floor, tossed up pillows, ransacked the closet, even peeked below the bed. <em>Nani mo</em>—nothing. A phone-cup sat solidly on the floor beside the window. She picked it up and reeled in the other end before bounding down the stairs to make report.</p>
      
      <p>In the living room, no Jacques.</p>
      
      <p>Panic sloshed up in her throat. Had he left her? Found the Bestiary and taken it for himself? No—he’d just gone to the backyard. She raced to join him.</p>
      
      <p>Everything in the garden was bigger, from the six elms to the pools around the path. And everything flickered so fast from pencil to crayon that Ami couldn’t keep her eyes in one place for more than a second. It was like reality was vacillating about what to wear. Jacques looked tiny in these psychedelic surroundings, and more scared than Ami had ever seen him. When she saw Table Turtle Isle, she knew why.</p>
      
      <p>Before the torrentially weeping willow stretched, from loftiest branch to lowest earth, a dazzling net of silver and grey. At the center flopped a red-splotched fish, who didn’t know mortal peril when he was smack in the middle of it.</p>
      
      <p>“Carpier,” Jacques lamented.</p>
      
      <p>Ami hated to admit it, but she had to: the poor wight looked exactly as Jacques had drawn him.</p>
      
      <p>“We have to save him!” Ami bawled. “There’s no telling how long he’ll last out of the water.”</p>
      
      <p>Gulping, Jacques ran beside her toward the bridge and web beyond.</p>
      
      <p>Ami fought back tears. Her friend needed her; his life was literally on the line. But who’d strung him up there?</p>

      <p>As her footstep sounded on the wood, Mr. Yanagi shook his head, raining green and black. The bridge rocked with the force. One Jacques gasped, the other’s rolled his bulby eyes. On a thick, thorny line descended the web’s proprietor.</p>
      
      <p>Ami squealed. Dangling in front of her like an inverted snowman, his big, squishy belly splotched with black and yellow, grinning fangily, Mr. Pest could’ve crawled straight from page three, save for the bib he wore.</p>
      
      <p>“Aaaamiiii.” His voice rumbled him to the tips of his legs.</p>
      
      <p>She looked to Jacques for support. He’d gone white as a sheet. She squeezed her eyes shut and turned around once before opening them. Still a giant spider.</p>
      
      <p>“Why’re you doing this, Mr. Pest?” she demanded, calling all her courage. “Aren’t we friends?”</p>
      
      <p>“Yes,” shuddered the spider, “friends. And friends keep their promises, don’t they, even if only to save a hostage.” He aimed an arm at thrashing Jacques Carpier.</p>
      
      <p>“Friends don’t <em>take</em> hostages, you baggy oaf!” Jacques St. Clair strode onto the island, blue eyes blazing. The spider’s yellow dulled to grey. Staring straight ahead, Jacques whispered, “What promise, Bon Ami?”</p>
      
      <em><p>Remember my promise?</p>
      
      <p>That if I ever got tired of living, you could eat me?</p>
      
      <p>Well, I have, and you can.</p>
      
          <p><strong>So eat me.</strong></p></em>
      
      <p>“NO!” wailed Ami, leaving Jacques’s protection to grab two spindly arms. The spider had regained his yellow and started salivating. Jacques’s arms grabbed at Ami from behind, but she wasn’t about to let go.</p>

      <p>“You can’t hurt my friends to make me keep a promise!” Ami scolded, shaking the spider-limbs. “We can talk about eating me later. You unstick Jacques Carpier right now!”</p>
      
      <p>Eight eyes blinked. Mr. Pest appeared to be considering.</p>
      
      <p>“All right.” He dropped with a crash, crawled up the line to his previous height, and pulled down a tank-sized fishbowl on a line of its own. He struck the web, and the shock pitched the carp into the bowl.</p>
      
      <p>“A trade,” he proposed. “My <em>promise</em> to you.”</p>
      
      <p>“A—?”</p>
      
      <p>“A Jacques,” growled Mr. Pest, “for a Jacques!”</p>
      
      <p>Swinging around, he knocked her protector into the pond.</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Jacques</em>!”</p>
      
      <p>Aghast, Ami slapped the cephalo part of Mr. Pest’s cephalothorax, sending him spinning, and hunched down near the water.</p>
      
      <p>“Jacques, are you <caps>ok</caps>?”</p>
      
      <p>He sputtered and flailed. The pond, once shallow, had swollen with the rest of the garden, and little bubbles were appearing on its surface. Jacques shouting something garbled.</p>
      
      <p>“What?” she called, the spider coming slowly to his senses.</p>
      
      <p>“<caps>Hot</caps>!”</p>
      
      <p>The pond seethed with bubbles now, and Ami saw in horror it was about to boil. An arm looped arond her neck and tightened. No time for distractions—she bit it till it withdrew, amid angry bellows. Mr. Pest squirted something from his abdomen into the pond, sending steam-clouds wafting from it. Jacques howled.</p>
      
      <p>Even in this color-contorting world, Ami could scarcely believe it: Mr. Pest was cooking Jacques alive!</p>
      
      <p>Elsewhere, the other Jacques bumped his whiskery snout against the fishbowl. It tipped, spilling him and his water onto the grass. Ami wanted to scream.</p>
      
      <p>If only she could do what she always did in a tough spot: leave it to her bestie, whose legendary brain made any danger disappear. Not this one, though.</p>
      
      <p>The spider squirted more heat into the pond, raising another howl. Jacques wouldn’t last much longer. The world pulsed, and shuddered, driven by thundering heartbeats from pencil to crayon, pencil to crayon…</p>
      
      <p>Jacques St. Clair was going to die!</p>
      
      <p>With that epiphany, the shifting stopped. Color-crazed Ami yielded to black and white. She cast out one more time, without thinking, trusting her hook to snag the key to his salvation.</p>
      
      <p><em>Check your pockets.</em></p>
      
      <p>She turned them out, a plastic cup from each.</p>
      
      <p>“Grab on!” she yelled, hurling the left cup. It zinged above the stew till it ran out of string and dropped into the water, feet from Jacques.</p>
      
      <p>“Where,” he sputtered, “did you get that?”</p>
      
      <p>The cup lost some opacity but remained as real as Ami had found it.</p>
      
      <p>“Where you left it!” she called.</p>
      
      <p>“What, in my wardrobe?”</p>
      
      <p>“No, in my window! Just grab it, will you?”</p>
      
      <p>Jacques grabbed it. Splitting her faith between the string and her arms, Ami pulled with all her might.</p>
      
      <p>“Cheating your way out of another promise, I see?”</p>
      
      <p>Ami ducked, inches under Mr. Pest’s crayon claw. He swung wildly at her, keen to add her to the menu. Cup to her chest, Ami fled across the bridge toward the house, praying the koi could flap to safety while she reeled Jacques off Table Turtle Isle.</p>
      
      <p>“I keep <em>all</em> my promises!” roared the spider. He crashed to earth again, and a strain seized Ami’s string. She doubted her own eyes. The scalding pondwater swirled around the island like bathwater toward a giant drain, threatening to pull Jacques down!</p>
      
      <p>Panic surged, and color bled back in.</p>
      
      <p>“This—isn’t—<em>fair</em>!” She yanked on the string. Miraculously, it didn’t break. Doubting it could survive the steaming liquid, though, she tried to keep it above the surface. Jacques couldn’t speak but held on doggedly. Pencil lines crossed crayon scrawls as the veins in his arm began to show.</p>
      
      <p>The world, visually speaking, had gone mad. It was as though two very different drawings of North Square vied for space on the same refrigerator, and that space grew exceedingly unstable. Even villainous Mr. Pest felt the schizophrenia; now and then he stopped his dance and gaped, wiggling his limbs in a ladylike way. At these times the pond went starkly still and cool, sending goosebumps all down Jacques’s arms. Ami stared at the surface as she pulled, in case watched ponds were subject to the same boiling regulations as pots and clocks. Then the sky changed and the cycle resumed. This happened again and again, faster and faster, until the slosh addled Jacques and everything around him.</p>
      
      <p>The last words of Jacques St. Clair in this world spilled into a plastic cup, zipped down an unbreakable string, and bounced off the walls of Ami’s cup into a sound her ears could interpret.</p>

      <p>“Two—North—Squares?”</p>
      
      <p>Then came a flash of colorless light, and Ami pulled on that string till her garden was gone.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>
      
      <p class="first"><caps>She came to </caps>in the dark.</p>
      
      <p>If this was death, it was softer than she’d imagined. Squishier, too, like the top of a pillow. Rolling onto her back, she opened her eyes to the light of a whirling ceiling fan. She watched one of its blades. The edges were no thicker than strips of light; no comic-book motion lines followed in its wake. Everything was back to normal.</p>
      
      <p>Turning beneath her comforter, she checked the nightstand.</p>
      
      <p>Well, not quite everything. The <em>Bestiary</em> was still missing. How? Assuming all that backyard business had been a nightmare…</p>
      
      <p>First things first. She’d been in her pajamas long enough.</p>
      
      <p>She hopped downstairs in a green sundress, with a mind to call Jacques and ask if she’d left the book at his place after all. Landing softly in the kitchen, bare feet shivering on the tile, she pushed her stool under the wall-mount phone and had one leg up when a sound from outside froze her hand on the receiver.</p>
      
      <p>It came from the garden. Shaking out images of her last visit, Ami jumped down, slid back the glass, slipped into her flip-flops, and stepped onto the stone.</p>
      
      <p>At once her eardrums were caressed by beautiful music. Relieved and intrigued, she followed the path toward its source. The melody, like none she could hum, cavorted down long strings of notes, unspooled by a rich bass voice.</p>
      
      <p>Someone had planted a patio table where the birdbath used to be, and misplaced the birdbath. A big, blue-and-white-striped umbrella sprouted from the center.</p>
      
      <p>Standing one-legged on the table, wrapped around and working magic on a tiny cello, was a singing bullfrog. His lyric sang the strain of casting a metamorphosis spell. Watching his bow slide gallantly across the strings, Ami knew her entry had only begun to describe his musicality.</p>
      
      <p>Someone was seated behind the table, reading a newspaper that hid most of him. He took no notice of Ami, and in the middle of his breakfast she hesitated to introduce herself. She stood politely and waited for a moment to cut in. From time to time a page would turn, but she didn’t see the hand responsible. But when one came out to pour its owner coffee from a jug on the table, she saw it was more of a claw, and very hairy. Seven more folded the paper and laid it on the table, uncovering eight milky eyes intent on Ami.</p>
      
      <p>“Oh, it’s you,” said Mr. Pest. “Delightful!”</p>
      
      <p>Ami knew she should shiver, like the last time she’d faced an eight-foot arachnid, but this was a different Mr. Pest, made not by crayon or pencil but of living, breathing, sagging tissue. His voice was silky and male, like her father’s when he tucked her into bed. He’d carefully set knives and forks around a plate of scrambled eggs and toast smeared with orange marmalade. He wore a pressed shirt under a brown, eight-sleeved tartan waistcoat with a green bowtie; a black bowler hat crowned his ash-colored head. This was the Mr. Pest Ami had pictured.</p>
      
      <p>He raised a small rod with eight lenses in front of his eyes. “Pardon the octacle; these eyes aren’t what they used to be…”</p>
      
      <p>“It’s lovely!” Ami blurted, though she didn’t want to offend someone so charming and dangerous. Sensing they’d like to converse in silence, the bullfrog hopped off the table and away toward one of the pools. Mr. Pest smiled.</p>
      
      <p>“I’ll put the kettle on,” he told her, flopping his abdomen onto the ground and rising on his four hind limbs. “Mr. Yanagi’s in the back; I suppose you’ll want to catch up?”</p>
      
      <p>Bowing leggily, he scuttled off—not toward the pond, but toward the house! She considered sneaking in through the front to warn her parents, but had a feeling they weren’t inside. Mr. Pest acted like he owned the place.</p>
      
      <p>As he’d said, the willow stood as sturdy as ever, though the koi pond, Ami noted from the bridge bridge, lay empty. She crossed the kendō-green and strolled around the tree to the generic-looking bush behind it. Not a web.</p>
      
      <p>“Now that we have a chance to talk,” a splintery voice drawled, “I thought you’d want to do it from the front.”</p>
      
      <p>Wide-eyed, Ami ran back to the front of the tree. The bark-lines curled to into a hollow about five feet from the ground, framing a pair of moving lips.</p>
      
      <p>“Welcome back, little one.” Each word re-shaped wood around the mouth.</p>
      
      <p>“Mr. Yanagi?” gasped Ami.</p>
      
      <p>“In the bark.”</p>
      
      <p>Ami curtsied and flopped, cross-legged, onto a springy leaf-pile.</p>
      
      <p>“Sorry, but I wasn’t expecting—I mean, we’ve never—”</p>
      
      <p>“That’s all right. Tell me, what brings you back to Table Turtle Isle?”</p>
      
      <p>Ami explained that she lived in the house behind the garden, and that lately a lot of things had been bringing her back to Table Turtle Isle. Mr. Yanagi was an easy tree to talk to. Ami spilled every detail of her last adventure before sensing how one-sided she’d made the conversation.</p>
      
      <p>“Dear me, that doesn’t sound like Mr. Pest at all.”</p>
      
      <p>Interesting—but Ami wondered more about another garden denizen.</p>
      
      <p>“What about Jacques?”</p>
      
      <p>“The boy you’re always bringing here?”</p>
      
      <p>“No, Jacques Carpier. Is he OK? I mean, he hasn’t choked or anything, has he?”</p>
      
      <p>“Heavens no!” A chuckle shook his highest branches. “The fool’s in perfect health. Popped out for a spell, but with his sense of direction he always ends up right back here.”</p>
      
      <p>How could the carp “pop out”? It didn’t really matter. Having had to abandon him on Table Turtle Isle, she rejoiced to hear he was safe.</p>
      
      <p>“About the boy, though,” broached the tree.</p>
      
      <p>“What about him?”</p>
      
      <p>“What do you think of him?”</p>
      
      <p>Ami’s cheeks went hot. Wasn’t that obvious? She shouldn’t have to say it.</p>
      
      <p>“Why d’you ask?”</p>
      
      <p>A lonely breeze ruffled Mr. Yanagi.</p>
      
      <p>“I’ve never had the chance to know. I was born from a seed, you see. My children, if I ever had any, were born the same way. A tree is whole and perfect by itself—or so I grew up believing. But watching you two has opened the photoreceptors in my chloroplasts to a strange new symbiosis. I just wondered if it’s true.”</p>
      
      <p>Brushing his roots with her eyes, Ami found new empathy with Mr. Yanagi.</p>
      
      <p>“I wish it were,” she murmured, ignoring the lock that slipped over her eyes. “I like to think so, sometimes. But I wonder, too.”</p>
      
      <p>How cool it felt for July.</p>
      
      <p>“I wonder,” Ami went on, “if humans are meant to fall in love. I think Jacques could stand on his own forever, like a tree. But I couldn’t be happy like that. Are you happy, Mr. Yanagi?”</p>
      
      <p>The hollow shrank, and the lines around it straightened. What was she thinking, asking a weeping willow that?</p>
      
      <p>“I am happy,” he answered, “as long as I have soil to eat, light for my leaves, and friends to shade.”</p>
      
      <p>Just the answer Ami had hoped not to get.</p>
      
      <p>“You wanna know what I think of Jacques?” she asked, vaulting to her feet. “I think he’s a damn know-it-all.”</p>
      
      <p>She hadn’t planned it, but it spilled out too fast to check.</p>
      
      <p>A disapproving wind soughed overhead. If trees had eyes, his would be narrow.</p>
      
      <p>“Forgive me, but I’m going to have to wash your mouth out with sap.”</p>
      
      <p>A limb descended from a lower bough, poked between Ami’s lips, and pumped a nasty, sticky gloop inside: the opposite of orange marmalade. Nearly choking, Ami swore off swearing.</p>
      
      <p>It was hard to stay friendly after that, so she bade the tree good day.</p>
      
      <p>Back in the kitchen, Ami took stock. This world looked more normal than the last one, but it wasn’t the one she knew. Her parents were gone, and the creatures from the <em>North Square Bestiary</em> looked and acted as she’d imagined them to: avuncular Mr. Pest, staid Mr. Yanagi. Something tied her imagination to the environment, but what?</p>
      
      <p>She had to find Jacques. He’d nearly figured out the flickering fridge-art North Square. Their powers combined could straighten all this out.</p>
      
      <p>But first, the sap. Sneaking past Mr. Pest, who bustled about the kitchen sans octacle, Ami ducked into the bathroom and closed the door. As she sipped a handful of water, odd noises from the toilet stole her attention.</p>
      
      <p>Gurgles grew to splashes, thrashes, and a reverse flush that drenched the seat. A white, whiskery head appeared, all bright smile and vacant stare.</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Jacques Carpier</em>?”</p>
      
      <p>“’Ello, love!” Jacques hailed, flapping fishy gums. “’Ow’s life?”</p>
      
      <p>“All right,” said Ami, “and I’m glad to see you are, too. But what’re you doing in my toilet?”</p>
      
      <p>“Discoverin’!” announced the carp. “Chasin’ new paths where’er they lead! It’s wha’ I do, y’know.”</p>
      
      <p>Ami did know; she’d named him, and not just for an explorer. Apparently he didn’t mind human wastewater. Weird as that was, it occurred to Ami that a veteran pipe-traveler might come in handy.</p>
      
      <p>“Have any of those paths taken you to 45 Pole?”</p>
      
      <p>Carpier thought. His every scale strained with the effort.</p>
      
      <p>“For’y-five Pole… Real big place, yeah? Lotsa doilies and things on the walls?”</p>
      
      <p>“That’s the one,” said Ami, impressed he could recall it. “Seen anyone there?”</p>
      
      <p>The koi shook his head, spraying toilet water everywhere. “No’ a soul. Tha’ place is quie’ as a tomb. Sorry, love.”</p>
      
      <p>So stunned was Ami, she didn’t notice the sink was still running.</p>
      
      <p>“Djoo check <em>every</em> bathroom?” She shoving her face near the bowl, to shout more effectively at the fish inside.</p>
      
      <p>“Twice over,” assured Carpier, rolling his misty eyes in his head. “Go’ meself lost in there for three days, once. Real big place, tha’. Lotsa doilies and things on the walls. No’ a soul inside.”</p>
      
      <p>That didn’t make sense. If Jacques wasn’t at his house and hadn’t come looking at hers, where was he? The carp could be confused. And if not, what did the report prove? Only that Jacques wasn’t loitering in the loo.</p>
      
      <p>“Don’t s’pose y’could give me a bi’ of a flush?”</p>
      
      <p>Thanking him for the intel, Ami pushed the handle, and in a swirl that reminded her horribly of the maelstrom in the koi pond, Jacques Carpier <em>shlorp</em>ed back into the pipes.</p>
      
      <p>Her back against the cold bathtub, Ami sank and tucked her head between her knees. This had been her fourth meeting with a character she’d created. What she’d suspected in the garden seemed clear now: her eyes were reporting what her mind had made. The creatures here weren’t that different from those in the <em>Bestiary</em>; in fact, they showed how the book might look if she’d been the only author. They were but shadows Ami cast by shining a flashlight on the originals. The traits she read in them got written here, from Mr. Pest’s genteel attire and Mr. Yanagi’s talking trunk to the explorations of Jacques Carpier. Tracing these details to her own head, with no explanation for how they’d leaked into this world, made Ami feel like a goddess with no control of her powers.</p>
      
      <p>She closed her eyes and willed those powers to activate. Nothing. It dawned on her she ranked no higher in the cosmos than a confused little girl sitting on a bathroom floor.</p>
      
      <p>That meant she’d have to find Jacques the old-fashioned way.</p>
      
      <p>She steeled herself for the world beyond. Passing the kitchen, she thanked Mr. Pest for his hospitality and asked him not to bother with the tea. Then she strode out the front door, looked both ways, and crossed the street. No cars came from either direction, and that worried her more than usual. Every driveway on Pole had at least one, but the road had zero. A glance east confirmed Frost Street to be as empty.</p>
      
      <p>Stepping between the columns at the St. Clair manor, Ami pushed the doorbell ringer all the way in. A formality—she expected no answer and didn’t mean to let that stop her. Counting “ten-Mississippi,”  she turned the handle and stepped in.</p>
      
      <p>The news from the toilet proved true. Jacques’s house lay in perfect order, but also perfect silence. Used to delicious smells from the kitchen and virtuosic strains from Parrin St. Clair’s piano, Ami balked to find the place so uninviting. But her parents were missing, too. If this world followed the same rules as the last, Jacques should be around. She swept calling from room to room, searching behind curtains, under furniture, in wastebaskets. She turned his room over and the study upside down. Only when she lifted a toilet seat could she declare Jacques absent.</p>
      
      <p>Parking on a the living-room sofa, Ami gazed up at the chandelier and reviewed her situation. She was mostly alone, in a world she’d somehow made, with only Bestiary beasts for company. She could accept that for now. But unless something changed, unless she worked out why her town transformed and how to stop it, she’d be stuck here forever. She could survive on her own until the bread and marmalade ran out; after that, things would get hard.</p>
      
      <p>She needed Jacques. Not for comfort, but for inductive reasoning. Jacques St. Clair was the key to solving everything, if she could hunt him down.</p>
      
      <p>32 and 45 Pole Street were the likeliest rendezvous points he’d have chosen. Others? There was another place she associated with him. While she couldn’t fathom why he’d choose to meet there without leaving a note, his mind worked in mysterious ways, and this was her only lead.</p>
      
      <p>Arriving at the corner of Pole and Frost, Ami noticed something that made her brain ache. The lamppost clock prepared to strike one, and she resented it afresh. The minute hand’s pretension to one o’clock when it was actually 12:59. The indolence at 1:01, claiming to be 1:00 still. If she ran the world, one o’clock would last exactly sixty seconds. But wait—she <em>did</em> run the world, or the world ran itself how she imagined it ought to run. Yet that clock had claimed 1:00 for all of two minutes now. Her theory of this world, as conforming to her specifications, no longer held water.</p>
      
      <p>So why were spiders wearing bowler hats and making tea in her kitchen? Why were weeping willows interrogating her, and ornamental fish popping up in toilets? Maybe her magic worked only on animals—<em>Mr. Yanagi, though</em>—on <em>living</em> things; but so far only four had shown its effects. Why those four?</p>
      
      <p>By the time her train of thought had reached this particular station, she stood before the arched entrance to the oldest, prettiest building in town. <sc>North Square Public Library, est. 1802</sc>.</p>
      
      <p>Pushing against a wooden door, Ami came into the lobby with footfalls that echoed off the high ceiling. Like a cathedral, it fed several passages into halls and alcoves. She came some Saturdays with Jacques, to help him haul the spoils from the front desk. The place took her breath every time.</p>
      
      <p>Today, though, it was unseasonably cool. Scanning rows of shelves, Ami felt she was being watched. This might’ve given her comfort—the world got less lonely with each creature she met—but this time it made her want to find Jacques as fast as she could and leave. Breezes riffled her hair and the folds of her dress. Had the air conditioner always blown so strongly? Unsettled, she sought science fiction or classics, whichever appeared first.</p>
      
      <p>On the second floor, among the mysteries, Ami saw her first ghost. It trickled from a spine like any other and knocked her into a wall of whodunits. She opened her mouth to scream, but an icy hand reached in and froze her voice. A laugh broke out behind her, then another and another, till a ghastly gaggle frolicked around her head.</p>
      
      <p>Her stomach sank. Every book on this floor must be scary or recently overdue.</p>
      
      <p>All the lights went out at once. Hoots and cackles rose and echoed. Blue blazes flickered all around, rolling steadily toward Ami. Thinking quickly, she pulled a book from the shelf and launched it toward another section, aisles away. Then she took off running, fast as flip-flops and a dress allow.</p>
      
      <p>She had to get off this floor, out of this library. Both were riddled with ravenous ghosts, which she knew because she’d put them there.</p>
      
      <p><em>“Ghosts like this one,” the entry read, “don’t exist. They are figments of overheated imaginations. If they were less fictional, however, they’d likely hide in scary and recently overdue books at the library, emerging to possess the souls of unwitting children.”</em></p>
      
      <p>Jacques had written that one. Wherever he was, he’d have no ghosts around. But Ami’s crayon had made the illustration: a horned, spike-ruffed devil with burning eyes and a malicious grin. Exactly like the monsters in the mystery section. That was the <em>Bestiary</em>’s power: everything Ami had put in it, with crayon or pen, was now printed on her reality!</p>
      
      <p>A hundred soul-starved screams shook the stairs as she she ran down them at a speed that would’ve given the librarian a heart attack. She took the last six steps at a bound, crashing to the marble floor. As the pack closed in, she scrambled to her feet and darted toward a curtained window at the west of the lobby. It was already afternoon.</p>
      
      <p>Seconds ahead of her pursuers, Ami leapt, grabbed at a great braided rope, and swung.</p>
      
      <p>The curtains parted. The ghosts stopped, those in back bumping poofily into those ahead. Their greedy grins sagged into gapes.</p>
      
      <p>As Ami’s knees banged the floor, the curtains flew back and the sun rushed in. Once, when she was three, Ami had put a marshmallow in the microwave. This sight was as satisfying as that.</p>
      
      <p>One problem down.</p>
      
      <p>Collapsing by the glary window, she wondered what to do now. Jacques couldn’t help; he didn’t exist here. She was locked in her half of a book that didn’t exist here, either. Unless reality’s fabric tore, she’d grow up here, talking to trees and spending her last days with a spider and a dim-witted carp.</p>
      
      <p>Was that so bad?</p>
      
      <p>All that could occupy her now was to find the other twenty-five <em>Bestiary</em> monsters. Maybe she could rule them as queen; she’d made them, more or less, so they ought to bend the knee (those that had knees, anyway). The thought cheered her less than she’d hoped.</p>
      
      <p>Turning to leave, she noticed something she’d walked past a hundred times. A scale model of North Square, every landmark carved so intricately she could tell the sculptor loved the town. A bronze pike stuck where she was standing now, NSPL, and from it Ami traced the road home with her finger. Her eyes slid to a heavy-looking anchor at the top of the model.</p>
      
      <p>The End, the highest point in town, marked by a boatless anchor. People called it the End because that’s what it must’ve spelled for whoever brought the anchor. The Jordans had picnicked there at the start of summer. Nice to see the anchor existed here, too.</p>
      
      <p>The world inside the <em>Bestiary</em> couldn’t be permanent, she reasoned. It had been born from another world, the one where she’d been born. Like her, it was young, incomplete.</p>
      
      <p>Unlike Ami, though, this new world couldn’t stand on its own. It was a land of fantasies, tea and pipes and talks with trees. No one could grow more tea when it ran out or fix the pipes when they broke. Why? Because Ami found such tasks boring. She ignored the cogs that turned the machines of her imagination. Now she was trapped in the result. Ami’s own selfishness had stranded her and her friends here. She felt sorry for her prison and its inmates.</p>
      
      <p>The more she thought about it, the less she believed this world’s mother—the perfect, functioning world—could’ve abandoned it. The universe didn’t work that way. Somewhere there must be a lifeline, a tether, an anchor to the parent world, the way her mother held her hand when they crossed the street.</p>
      
      <p>Why not? She’d nowhere else to be.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>

      <p class="first"><caps>The End </caps>was too far for an evening stroll, but home was only fifteen minutes away. She found the door unlocked.</p>
      
      <p>Mr. Pest lounged in her father’s favorite armchair, octacling a Tolstoy novel, legs spilling over cushions, when Ami rejoined him.</p>
      
      <p>“You’re back!” He marked his place and clamped the novel shut. “Having a good time?”</p>
      
<p>“Yes, thank you,” answered Ami, thinking it strange to be asked this in her own house. “If you’re not too busy, Mr. Pest, I have a favor to ask.”</p>
      
<p>“Ask away!” The spider tugged the buttons on his waistcoat, an oddly handsome thing for him to do.</p>
 
<p>“Can you take me to the End?”</p>
      
<p>Not only did he know what she meant; he offered to take her right away. Not having ridden spiderback, Ami wondered how it worked. A lot of scuttling—but was silk involved? Would they sling between trees?</p>
      
<p>Instead, Mr. Pest unlocked her parent’s green Honda and stuffed his abdomen into the driver’s seat. A feat of wriggling and squeezing got his seatbelt on.</p>
      
<p>“Changed your mind?” he asked Ami, who stood agape in the driveway.</p>
      
<p>She shook her head, climbed in, buckled up, and banished every spider stereotype she’d ever formed.</p>
      
<p>“Then off we go!”</p>
      
<p>The engine growled to life. Mr. Pest shifted the stick into reverse and started the journey up the mountain.</p>
      
      <p>Knowing it would be rude to stare, Ami stole glances at him by pretending to check for other cars (obviously there were none). He filled his seat and some of hers, his idle limbs waving aimlessly. Yet Mr. Pest was an expert driver. He could depress the clutch, shift, change radio stations, tap along with the music on the roof of the car, fish a tin of mints out of the glovebox, pop one between his fangs, offer one to Ami, and steer all at about the same time, without stalling.</p>
      
<p>Turning the mint in her fingers, she found a slogan on the tin.</p>
      
      <p><em>AFTERFLESH MINTS: When you eat the human meat, the cool mint taste that can’t be beat—Afterflesh™ fresh!</em></p>
      
      <p>“Good?” inquired the driver.</p>
      
      <p>It was, and Ami told him so.</p>
      
      <p>Midway up the mountain, Mr. Pest swerved to dodge a jet of flame. Two more jets nearly fried the Honda. When something huge, pink, and slimy waddled onto the road, Ami knew their source: the salamander from Jacques’s backyard. It appeared to have caught a cold, ruffling its ear-feathers and spraying phlegmy fire with each cough.</p>
      
      <p>“Got a cough drop, Mr. Pest?”</p>
      
      <p>Deftly maneuvering the Honda, the driver pulled one from his coat and lobbed it into the salamander’s mouth. A puff of smoke and the coughing ceased. Relieved, the salamander tromped back up the mountain.</p>
      
      <p>After a while, the Honda stopped among familiar foliage.</p>
      
      <p>“We’re here,” announced Mr. Pest, a little sadly. He downshifted to first gear but left the engine running.</p>
      
      <p>Ami surprised him by hugging as far around him as she could. Spreading his fangs in a smile, Mr. Pest wrapped her in a tickly four-armed squeeze. She thanked him for the lift, opened the door, and stopped. There was something she had to know.</p>
      
      <p>“Mr. Pest, do you really eat people?”</p>
      
      <p>“Oh, yes. But never without orange marmalade.”</p>
      
      <p>After six friendly waves he drove away. Hiking her dress above the brambles underfoot, Ami followed the trail to a wide meadow.</p>
      
      <p>There, half sunk in soil, was the enormous iron anchor. After a long day of fieldwork, she’d reached the End.</p>
      
      <p>She climbed onto the fluke that still saw sun. Balancing like a gymnast on its slippery surface, she gazed over the world her imagination had supported.</p>
      
      <p>From here she saw it all. Her house winked up from the valley, up the street from Jacques’s. Frost Street met Pole beneath the old lamppost clock and wended south, over the river toward Frost Park Elementary. Wistfully she wondered what fourth grade would’ve been like. Jacques had seemed to like it, but he’d like school anywhere.</p>
      
      <p>Something was off, though. Her North Square sat on a New England plain, but beyond this town frothed a sea of misty white. Also, an unfamiliar spit jutted from the town’s eastern end. Dark and craggy, it must’ve measured miles.</p>
      
      <p>As though it felt her stare, the spit <em>moved</em>.</p>
      
      <p>Ami had seen strange sights in the past two days, but none had prepared her for this. The landmass lengthened, swayed from northeast to southeast, and turned west toward her. A cry rocked North Square from end to End.</p>
      
      <p>The town had a head.</p>
      
      <p>North Square was alive!</p>
      
      <p>Could this be the <em>Bestiary</em>’s magic? Had anything she’d written spawned it? The town became an animal, so large its movements weren’t felt by the creatures on its back.</p>
      
      <p>North Square was <em>alive</em>.</p>
      
      <p>What would Jacques give to know that?</p>

      <p><em>Oh, Jacques.</em></p>
      
      <p>She hadn’t even bidden him goodbye. Her affection hadn’t been a secret, but there was still so much she’d wanted to grow up to be able to say.</p>
      
      <p>How sorry she was for being such a headache sometimes.</p>
      
      <p>How grateful for his kindness and protection.</p>
      
      <p>How much she loved his mother’s cookies.</p>
      
      <p><em>That I really do want to marry you someday.</em></p>
      
      <p>She shut her eyes and waited. Her idea hook bobbed. Nothing would bite, no path to Jacques would open.</p>
      
      <p><em>Open your eyes.</em></p>
      
      <p>Not yet.</p>
      
      <p><em><caps>Open your eyes!</caps></em></p>
      
      <p>Had she caught something after all? Her lashes lifted to admit the world. A string around the iron ring at the top of the anchor dangled a red plastic cup. Beyond the knot, nearly invisible against the sky, the string stretched infinitely.</p>
      
      <p>“No,” breathed Ami, “<em>way</em>.”</p>
      
      <p>She took the cup and spoke the one word left in her.</p>
      
      <p>“Jacques.”</p>
      
      <p>Only the wind answered. It blew more fiercely here, on the town-beast’s dorsal fin, than in the valley. Ami had just resolved to sit and never move, cradling that cup to the end of her story, when she heard it.</p>
      
      <p>“St. Clair to Bon Ami, come in, Bon Ami, d’you read?”</p>
      
      <p>Hogwash. Codswallop. Too good to be true. But she heard it, and there was but one answer.</p>
      
      <p>“Loud and—clear.”</p>
      
      <p>Fatigue caught up with her. The voice she’d despaired of ever hearing again had returned to her across the mist, zipping down a string, translated by a cup.</p>
      
      <p>“Did you know North Square was alive?” To see his face, wherever it existed now, when he heard that!</p>
      
      <p>“I hadn’t considered the possibility,” Jacques admitted, ringing the cup with a laugh. “Always something new to learn.”</p>
      
      <p>“It’s the <em>Bestiary</em>’s work.”</p>
      
      <p>“I know,” said Jacques. “I suspected it yesterday, in the flickering world. Here’s what I’ve worked out. The <em>Bestiary</em> holds the power of creation. When we finished it on July 28, it built a version of the town from the entries we wrote, and sometime in the night it overwrote the real one. Unfortunately, the authors of the new  one couldn’t agree on how to treat their subjects, so the new North Square was highly unstable.”</p>
      
      <p>“Is that why everything kept switching from crayon to pencil?”</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Oui</em>! The flickering was a kind of identity crisis. The crayon scheme, based on your <em>Bestiary</em> illustrations, reflected your way of looking at the world; the pencil scheme reflected mine. Every creature we met was defined by two different sets of instructions, yours and mine.</p>
      
      <p>“Mr. Pest, for instance. You drew him, so when the world wore your view, he looked like an animation of your drawing. But when the world switched to my view, he had to obey a different set of instructions: the text that I provided. The sour personality came from garbled instructions. With me so far?”</p>
      
      <p>“Yes, it all makes sense!” cried Ami, understanding now. “Our two worldviews fought each other, just like we did. Since the town could wear only one color scheme at a time, it had to decide by show of feeling. When my feelings were stronger than yours, the crayons won, and the pencils came back when yours caught up.”</p>
      
      <p>She recalled the way the color had drained when she made herself calm down while Jacques was drowning. Clearly, she’d managed to stifle her emotions at a time when his were raging.</p>
      
      <p>“But things heated up fast,” Jacques continued. “Before long, we both felt so strongly that the world couldn’t take the strain, and it split in two, sending each of us to a separate half. The previous North Square kept so busy reconciling our differences that it had to follow our instructions to the letter—or to the picture. But now that we each had a town, the two North Squares could start taking liberties. You may have noticed the characters in your world don’t look exactly like your drawings of them. That’s your town at work. It read the instructions in your entries, like a smile done in crayon, and interpreted them into a picture of how you view your subjects. Am I way off with this?”</p>
      
      <p>“No, you’re exactly right!” Ami assured. “Mr. Pest is a perfect gentleman now! But how do you know all this? Has the same thing happened to you?”</p>
      
      <p>It occurred to Ami that Jacques would have to look closely to tell his drawings from the real-life creatures that inspired them. This made his theory even more impressive.</p>
      
      <p>“More or less,” he answered, and that was all. Ami couldn’t see his expression, but she sensed he didn’t want to talk about his town.</p>
      
      <p>“So our book is just a silly projector,” she said, beholding her town from the anchor at The End, “projecting the way we view the world!”</p>
      
      <p>“That’s about the shape of it.”</p>
      
      <p>“Jacques,” she asked, “where are you right now? In your town?”</p>
      
      <p>“The End. Why?”</p>
      
      <p>“Me too! How d’you think we both thought to climb up here, found the phones, and started talking to each other?”</p>
      
      <p>“Coincidence, I guess? What I’d like to know is how the phone got here in the first place, and why our worlds are linked.”</p>
      
      <p>An interesting question. Ami had almost expected to find the cup there, on the anchor. But who’d tied it?</p>
      
      <p>Suddenly she knew. “When you were drowning in the flickering pond, I tried to use these cups to save you. You grabbed on, and I pulled, and I was still pulling when the town split apart. I think we each took a cup into the next town, and the string ended up in the only place it could: in the middle!”</p>
      
      <p>“Brilliant, Bon Ami!”</p>
      
      <p>Happiness flooded her cheeks. How many coincidences had enabled this conversation? But there was still something she longed to know.</p>
      
      <p>“What’s your town like, Jacques?”</p>
      
      <p>As soon as she asked, she wished she hadn’t. If the answer was something private or painful, it was none of her business.</p>
      
      <p>“Sorry,” she said in a fluster. “If you don’t want to tell me, that’s all ri—”</p>
      
      <p>“It’s black and white,” said a leaden voice in the cup. “Not like a pencil drawing, more like an old photograph. Mr. Pest is just a big garden spider. Old Jacques is just a carp. The library’s empty, the salamander’s harmless, the willow doesn’t weep.”</p>
      
      <p>Ami heard humiliation behind the words. Clearly Jacques had thought about why his town had turned out that way, and wasn’t proud of the results.</p>
      
      <p>But he’d told her.</p>
      
      <p>“I <em>know</em> you can see in color,” Ami heard herself insist. “What color are my eyes?”</p>
      
      <p>“I—dunno. Black in the middle. But everywhere else they’re kinda brownish, dark brown in some places and more, ah, burnt sienna in others. Except for the tops—those are white circles, like glittery snow.”</p>
      
      <p>Ami nearly fell off the anchor.</p>
      
      <p>At last, the cards were all on the table. Hope had kindled in Ami’s chest, and the surrounding organs were starting to catch. Now that it <em>could</em> happen, it had to.</p>
      
      <p>“How do we get back home?” she asked.</p>
      
      <p>“I’ve been working on that, too,” said Jacques, brightening. “Maybe you can help me think of something.”</p>
      
      <p>“What kind of something?”</p>
      
      <p>“Well, I look at it this way. We started with one North Square—ours. Then we replaced it with another, the hybrid one. That split into two towns, yours and mine. Now we want to get back to one town.”</p>
      
      <p>“Right,” assented Ami, “ours.”</p>
      
      <p>“How do we get from two towns to one?”</p>
      
      <p>Ami knew a subtraction problem when she heard one. “Kill one of them?”</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Sacré bleu</em>!” Jacques cried. “And murder its maker? No thanks! If only we could go back in time… rewrite the <em>Bestiary</em>…”</p>
      
      <p>Ami didn’t comment. She stood on her anchor, fin of a living town. The sky smelled like rain. She closed her eyes, pulled out the idea rod, and left the rest to habit.</p>
      
      <p>Two bubbles floated across her mind’s eye. One held Ami’s ideas, the other Jacques’s. The bubbles burst, and all the ideas fell into a funnel, which dropped them into a third bubble. This bubble floated heavily for a while, but soon swelled up and burst into two. Her perspective changed; Ami now watched from behind the film of one of those two bubbles. Beneath her, a second funnel. Just when it looked like history would repeat itself, the bubbles split again—but this time, each gave only half its contents to the funnel. The last bubble wafted uneventfully away, and Ami had her answer.</p>
      
      <p>“Let’s mate the towns.”</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Pardon</em>?”</p>
      
      <p>“We’ll mate the two North Squares! If we can get our towns to have a baby, maybe we can find our way home somehow,” said Ami, adding, “I saw it work with bubbles once.”</p>
      
      <p>“Genius!” Jacques started talking very fast. “I don’t know what bubbles you’re talking about any more than I know how we’ll pull this off; but in theory it’s magnificent! The combined genes of both our towns should restore the one we left behind! But surely it can’t be tried at this range?”</p>
      
      <p>“No,” agreed Ami, regarding the wall of angry clouds to the west. “We’ll need to bring our towns together.”</p>
      
      <p>“How, I wonder. Have you tried talking with your town yet? We could ask them to move.”</p>
      
      <p>Ami looked dubiously east, where the huge head grazed on something under the mist. Even her voice wouldn’t carry that far. Her plan had died before its birth. All she could do was stare, wait, and pray.</p>
      
      <p><em>No</em>, protested a voice inside her.</p>
      
      <p>No?</p>
      
      <p><em>No. You can do what you did last time.</em></p>
      
      <p>What’s that?</p>
      
      <p><em>You can pull.</em></p>
      
      <p>She had the string. Her lifeline to the boy she loved, it could bring anything she wanted: his voice if she was lonely, his safety if he was threatened, his town if he was a galaxy away. Tightening the knot around the ring of the anchor, she took that string in her hands and pulled. It didn’t matter that she was one girl versus tons of town, or that the string was little thicker than floss. All that mattered was making things move.</p>
      
      <p>Not that she had to do it alone.</p>
      
      <p>“Gonna need your help on this one, Jacques.” As soon as she spoke, the line went taut.</p>
      
      <p>“You have the best ideas, Bon Ami.”</p>
      
      <p>When both kids pulled, the towns themselves couldn’t ignore it. Hand over hand, arm over arm, Ami reeled her quarry in, bracing her flip-flopped feet against the anchor’s crosspiece. Miles below, the beast called North Square groaned and fidgeted. Then, with a quake that nearly bowled Ami off the mountain, it moved. Ton by ton, the town crawled east. Ami pulled harder.</p>
      
      <p>There was no telling how long she stood at the End of her world, tugging on that string, before a second sun appeared. She tugged until a speck appeared beneath it, floating toward her on the carpet of white. Its sun followed behind it, too, so each North Square headed east toward the other. She channeled her excitement into her arms. The harder she pulled, the lower both suns sank, and by the time Jacques St. Clair came close enough to hail, only the starlight told his hat was orange.</p>
      
      <p><caps>“BOOOOOOOOON-SOOOOOOOOOOIR!”</caps></p>
      
      <p><caps>“KON-BAN WAAA!”</caps> he returned.</p>
      
      <p>Riding the crosspiece of his anchor, doffing his hat, lone spot of color, with a courtly bow, he’d never looked so gallant. Ami considering diving  into the mist and swimming the rest of the way, but a deafening call distracted her. A second call answered.</p>
      
<p>“It’s happening!” Ami saw Jacques shout into his cup. 
    Her anchor shot out of the earth and threw her to the grass, pushed by a braid of thick, gnarly vines. It curved across the sky, anchor still attached, and squinting Ami could just make out an identical braid curving toward it.</p>
      
      <p>The anchors clanged and fused. Around where they met swelled a silver sphere.</p>
      
      <p>An egg!</p>
      
      <p>The path lay open. Ami streaked across it like a comet. Her sandal slapped the egg at the same time Jacques’s boot reached it. She leapt, he buckled, and they half-knelt until he could set her on her feet.</p>
      
      <p>Then, in Ami’s latest fantasy come to life, he found his ounce of romance and kissed her.</p>
      
      <p>It felt nothing like the dress rehearsals in her dreams: softer, safer, and shorter, not to mention real and taking place on top of an egg in—outer space? At least the stars were twinkling. Ami couldn’t have written herself a better first kiss.</p>
      
      <p>Jacques, to judge from his face, could’ve.</p>
      
      <p>“If that’s what kissing tastes like,” he remarked, half to himself, “I’m afraid I can’t see why grownups love it so.”</p>
      
      <p>The sap—<em>gah</em>, she’d forgotten the sap! She apologized for the taste, explaining in as few words as she could that Mr. Yanagi had been sterner her town.</p>
      
      <p>“Is that it?” chuckled Jacques. “All the same, if you’re still keen on marrying me, don’t expect another of those for a couple years.”</p>
      
      <p>Before she could demand to know why, the shell beneath their feet began to hum, then glow. A crack appeared, one she noticed was shaped like Frost Street. A second crack etched Pole into the shell at a right angle to the first; others made more streets she recognized. Silver yielded to green, brown, blue, and red, shading in woods, filling in the river, till the whole shell drew a perfect map of North Square.</p>
      
      <p>It quaked and split at all the major streets, leaking light, and in another moment burst.</p>
      
      <p>The way her dress and hair were whipping, she must be falling far. Yet she and Jacques weren’t moving; the world around them was. Their courtship complete, the two behemoths faded into the rising mist. Hovering above, Ami glimpsed cars, houses, pets, people, a host of other familiar things. She closed her eyes, nestled in Jacques’s shoulder, and let the white light take her.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>    
           
      <p class="first"><caps>“Jacques, </caps>haven’t you been listening at all?”</p>
      
      <p>The “<em>Oui</em>” mumbled over the edge of <em>Le Petit Prince</em> confirmed he hadn’t. In the month in North Square mark III, he’d experimented with books in French, which she might tolerate if this weren’t recess. The other fifth-graders at Frost Park didn’t razz him for it, for rumor told Jacques St. Clair could kill with his brain alone, but one fourth-grader didn’t mind risking her life to steal his attention. After five minutes recounting show-and-tell for his benefit, Ami discovered he’d been cheating on her the whole time with Saint-Exupery.</p>
      
      <p>“Why do I bother with you?” She shoved a big blue book into her new backpack. “Loads of boys would fight to play tetherball with me.”</p>
      
      <p>Jacques muttered something perilously like “Be my guest” and turned the page. Fine—Ami pulled out a book of her own: <em>The Jungle Book</em> by Rudyard Kipling, from the school library. She opened up the front cover, paused, and grabbed Jacques’s shoulder.</p>
      
      <p>“I never get tired of seeing these,” she said.</p>

    </div>
      
      <p>Jacques never got tired of seeing them, either. “They named their contest to spite us, you know.”</p>
      
      <p>Now that she knew he was looking, Ami flopped the book open in front of her face and studied it with a very serious expression, half expecting him to return his little prince. Instead, he pointed at a black-and-white illustration of the serpent Kaa and said, “Can you imagine if we’d tossed in one of <em>these</em>?”</p>
      
      <p>“I can imagine a lot,” Ami answered. “Woulda made show-and-tell even wilder.”</p>
      
      <p>A boy in probably the grade strode up to where they were sitting and drawled, “Is it true there’s two of you now?”</p>
      
      <p>Jacques ignored him, but his companion sprang up and demanded, “Two of what?”</p>
    
      <p>“Y’know, you <em>genius</em> types.”</p>
      
      <p>The avenging spirit fizzled, leaving only confusion. Had he said “two”?</p>
      
      <p>“Heard some kid gabbing ’bout a bess-cherry girl at show-and-tell. Said she’s even as smart as you, Jacques.”</p>
      
      <p>Oh, for a shinai to reward his blasphemy!—but Jacques held her at bay and addressed the older boy.</p>
      
      <p>“You heard correctly,” he said. “Tell your friends that yes, we’re two now.”</p>
      
      <p>Satisfied, the sixth-grader lumbered off to play.</p>
      
      <p>“What was that about?” Ami wondered. “Why’d you tell him that, Jacques?”</p>
      
      <p>“Why?” echoed Jacques. “Because it’s true, Bon Ami! How many fourth-graders can write a book? Or speak two languages?”</p>
      
      <p>“There was you,” Ami said flatly. “I don’t <em>speak</em> Japanese, I just know hello and good night and stuff.”</p>
      
      <p>“Then there’s your vocabulary,” continued Jacques. “I’m sure you could understand most of what I read. You’d just get bored.”</p>
      
      <p>Eager to flout him, Ami swiped a Shakespeare from his bag and pointed to a random word. “‘Forsooth’? Greek to me.”</p>
      
      <p>Jacques cackled to hear her prove his point. “Face it, Ami, you’re one of those,” and here he affected a sixth-grade drawl, “<em>genius</em> types.”</p>
      
      <p>Giggling, Ami relocated <em>The Jungle Book</em> to the pocket with the <em>North Square Bestiary</em> and thought. Was she? She hadn’t noticed. Maybe she’d pretend no one had told her. Then she wouldn’t have to think about it.</p>

      <p>“That why you keep me around, Jacques?” she asked. “’Cause I can read?”</p>
      
      <p>Slipping an arm around her shoulder, Jacques shook his head.</p>
      
      <p>“I keep you around,” he said, “’cause you remind me that there’s more to life than reading.”</p>
      
      <p>Ami Jordan—samurai, goddess, genius—glanced dreamily from the yellow face of the clock above the door to the freckly face of the smartest boy in her school and felt, for the first time in her life, she had all the time in the world.</p>
