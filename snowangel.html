      <p class="epi"> “[Happiness] can no more exist in a heart, that is continually alive to minute circumstances, than in one that is dead to feeling.”—Ann Radcliffe, <em>Mysteries of Udolpho</em></p>

      <p class="first"><span class="dropcap" style="margin-bottom: 0">J</span><caps>une 18 </caps>was a dark day for eighth-graders in Durmont. Not just because they hadn’t seen the sun in three months; in the Dukedom of Antarctica, you learned to accept that. Standardized tests were a different story. The duke had set one just four days before the winter solstice, so instead of ice skating, the eighth grade was packed into desks like ice cubes in a tray, flurrying their no. 2 pencils at the first prompt: “Describe the system of habitation employed by the cities of the Polar Plateau and the scientific processes that facilitate it.”</p>
    
      <p>In other words, reasoned a boy called Linus in the third row from the back, what had changed Antarctica from the desolate, freezing wasteland in his history book to the desolate, freezing wasteland he awoke to every morning? That was easy enough; a better question would be whose great idea it had been to bother with this godforsaken continent in the first place. Since the duke cared about details, however, Linus decided to oblige.</p>
      
      <p>System of habitation: Basically, all hung on the Vents, a handful of miraculous gates through which the earth had been squandering its geothermal surplus since the beginning of time. Before their discovery, the Vents gave Antarctica nothing beyond the odd angry cyclone. That changed with the Hotbots—floating fans that circled the Vents, sucking in heat and coughing it back, until the air above the Polar Plateau was slightly warmer than a meat locker. This was enough to get Antarctica declared habitable at last, and cities like Durmont flew up like masochistic moths around the Vents.</p>
      
      <p>As for the scientific processes that facilitated it, a few mentions of “radiation” and “convection” would be enough to satisfy the duke.</p>
      
      <p>There could be no advancing to the next prompt without incensing the proctor, who flitted from desk to desk ensuring no one did, so Linus retired his pencil and sat. When this turned out as boring as he expected, he unfolded his scarf in his lap, refolded it, smoothed his jet-black hair, doodled on his scratch sheet, and struggled not to look in the direction he’d promised himself he absolutely wouldn’t look in.</p>
      
      <p>But there are only so many ways to fold a scarf, and once the scratch sheet began to depict what lay in that direction, Linus stopped struggling and looked in it.</p>
      
      <p>The girl in the seat two columns over from his bowed thoughtfully over her essay, gray eyes gleaming, the flush of cold still in her cheek. <em>Can’t think about Clare now</em>, not during such an important exam; but some choices just weren’t his to make. Her lips’ intelligent purse, the way her hair arrested the light in its darkness, fixed his eye and froze his breath. Pioneering a third page, her pencil showed no sign of slacking.</p>
      
      <p>This seemed to please the flame-haired boy in the desk behind hers, who, Linus noted through sudden slits, had been diligently copying her response since the test began. Berg was the rankest vermin on the continent, and no one else could see it—least of all the proctor, oblivious in some other aisle. None but Linus could appreciate that Berg went to school three miles from the Polar Plateau’s third-largest Vent, cavorted regularly in the Hotbots’ shadows, and couldn’t write a sentence about either without copping it from Clare. Finding him less agreeable to look at, Linus resumed his first distraction.</p>
      
      <p>His reverie broke around an unexpected <em>snap</em>—a gift from the proctor’s ruler to his desk.</p>
      
      <p>“Best rein in that wandering eye, Linus, before somebody thinks you’re <em>cheating</em>.”</p>
      
      <p>Linus felt his face purple in indignation. “That’s preposterous,” he said softly, “and you know it.”</p>
      
      <p>Incapable of refuting the top student in the class on that point, the proctor could only turn up her nose, simper, “Then you’ll kindly hold off goggling at girls until <em>after</em> the examination,” and flit haughtily away.</p>
      
      <p>Nineteen pairs of eyes left their booklets to scope which girl the twentieth was goggling at, but Linus was already pretending to proofread. <em>These busybodies should be doing the same</em>, because according to his watch—</p>
      
      <p><em>Ding!</em> announced the egg timer on the proctor’s desk.</p>
      
      <p>“Pencils down!” announced the proctor.</p>
      
      <p><em>Way ahead of you</em>, announced Linus, but not out loud. In more ways than you can imagine.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>
      
      <p class="first"><caps>June 18</caps> was a dark day until just after dinner, when something dazzling happened. Linus was curled up almost comfortably on the sill of the picture window in the family den, tuning out a TV report on declining geothermal harvests and quizzing his brother Sallust from the fifth-grade reader in his lap, their progress hampered by sneezes from the ottoman beside the fire.</p>
      
      <p>“I don’t know why you don’t just wear your scarf like Mom says.”</p>
      
	  <p>“’S ugly,” answered the black-haired, blue-eyed ball of blankets on the ottoman. “And I don’t mean just the pattern. Every thread in every stitch is uglier than the one beside it.”</p>
      
	  <p>“That’s illogical,” Linus pointed out, “and it’s a decent scarf. There’s a lemming on it, right?”</p>
      
      <p>“An <em>ugly</em> lemming. I don’t know what Mom was thinking when she bou<em>aaa</em><span class="caps">CHOO</span>! (“Gesundheit,” said Linus.) Honestly.” The ball wiped its nose on the top blanket. “Ask me another.”</p>
      
      <p>“But that’s just why you should wear it,” the elder replied, watching snowflakes smear the glass as he ignored his brother’s request. “That scarf was a gift, and gifts make givers happy when you wear them. That’s the whole point.”</p>
      
	  <p>“Well, this one doesn’t make me happy. But enough scarf talk. Ask me another question.”</p>
      
	  <p>“You’re insensitive,” said Linus.</p>
      
	  <p>“No, just insensible.”</p>
      
	  <p>Sallust’s intelligence was one of the comforts of his brother’s existence. Not many children would be caught dead studying on the first night of the solstice holiday, not even the sick ones, and an hour in this child’s company after eight in the eighth grade could be enormously refreshing. But just now Linus sensed a cold in Sallust’s heart to rival the one in his head. In this respect, Sallust was just like everybody else.</p>
      
	  <p>“And you remember the difference?”</p>
      
	  <p>“Of course,” whined Sallust before a mighty sneeze. (“Gesundheit.”) “Sensitivity has two parts, intuition and sensibility. Intuition is the good part that lets folks know what other folks are feeling; sensibility is the bad part that takes offense when it gets its feelings hurt.”</p>
      
	  <p>“Very good,” said Linus. It prided him to see Sallust take this definition as seriously as the others he’d taught him, for this view of sensitivity was original to Linus. So simple in the mouth of a ten-year-old, but not something Linus supposed anyone else could’ve come up with.</p>
      
	  <p>“But none of it matters,” said Sallust stuffily, “outside of Jane Austen novels. You gonna ask me another question or not?”</p>
      
	  <p>The boy in the window looked down at the impudent ball on the ottoman and saw, once again, nothing more than a kid with a cold, of which Antarctica suffered no shortage.</p>
      
	  <p>It was then that the dazzling thing happened. Through the snow spatter Linus discerned the earliest hints of a change in the sky outside: a trace of purple, a suggestion of green. The colors reached the floor, and four azure eyes widened in delight.</p>
      
	  <p>Linus’s darted to the mantel clock’s second hand.</p>
    
      <p>Three—</p>
      
      <p>Two—</p>
      
      <p><em>One—</em></p>
      
      <p>“<caps>LIGHT FIGHT!</caps>”</p>
      
	  <p>Whoever’s voice had started it, there was no stopping the event. Scattering blankets and tissues, the boys raced instinctually to the closet where every kid in the dukedom keeps his most cherished possession.</p>
      
      <p>“Not so fast, mister.” Their mother seized her youngest rounding a corner into the hall. “<em>You</em> have a date with the bed. Doctor’s orders, I’m afraid.”</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Mom</em>!” Sallust protested, arousing little sympathy from Linus as he fished around for his boots. “D’you <em>know</em> what’s happening right” (pause) “out” (he must be pointing) “<em>there</em>?”</p>
      
	  <p>“Too sick for school,” pronounced their father from the living room, “too sick for light fights. Sorry, kiddo—house rule.”</p>
      
	  <p>A groan and stomp for every stair to Sallust’s bedroom confirmed no further deliberation. Most big brothers would’ve shouted up “I’ll let you know how it was,” but Linus wasn’t cruel and had somewhere more important to be.</p>
      
	  <p>There are but three good things about winters in Antarctica. First, solstice parties. Second, it’s easier to fall asleep on dark nights than on bright ones. Third, of course, is the</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Aurora australis</em>, here I come.”</p>
      
	  <p>Boots strapped tight, snowboard under arm, Linus flung open the front door and charged into the waiting night.</p>
      
	  <p>Raw cold gripped him at once, but his thoughts sailed skyward. The Southern Lights were up and dancing, twisting oceans of purple into verdant plains that trembled as if about to crack.</p>
      
	  <p>“Brilliant,” Linus breathed.</p>
      
      <p>His classmates were already sliding around lampposts on Icing Square, and more poured from bright rectangles along the street: eighth-, seventh-, even third- and fourth-graders packing baby boards, pulled irresistibly to the rendezvous. Tonight wore a coat of sugary snow. Steps crunched, laughs rang, breaths swirled in eager streams. Snowman sentinels guarded driveways. And <em>there</em>—a little ahead, in the cold gold light of the lampposts—Linus saw his favorite scarf in the world.</p>
      
	  <p>As thick, red, and toasty as a scarf could look, emblazoned with a grinning penguin on the front, it wrapped Clare’s neck snugly enough to repel the fiercest frosts. Word was she’d knitted it herself, sanctifying it in Linus’s sight.</p>
      
	  <p>Suddenly this scarf was encircled, squeezed, and tugged by a heavy glove. Berg. Bright locks burst lustily from his cap-band, framing a face that could only feign feeling, as his head could only imitate answers. Somehow Clare was glad to see him. This was certain; had the lamp gone out and hidden that bright smile, Linus could still have tasted it on the frigid air. Clare’s spirits altered everything.</p>
      
	  <p>Except for Berg. The only feeling his palate could catch from others was anger. Of that he was a conoisseur.</p>
      
      <p>“Yo, <em>Linatic</em>!” he hailed. The old name froze the blood in Linus’s veins. An artifact from hotter-tempered days, when a host of small offenses set him howling, the Linatic brand kept its effect whenever Berg and cronies wanted an encore. It was silly, it was stupid, and it still hurt.</p>
      
	  <p>Especially in front of Clare.</p>
      
	  <p>Well, she could manage him. Loath to linger by Berg, Linus faded into the forest of coats, caps, boots, and boards on the square. Bright murmurs raced beneath the shifting sky. They waited for a word. When all the lampposts were surrounded, Berg spoke up.</p>
      
	  <p>“This year”—he pumped his thick-gloved fist into the air—“solstice comes early!”</p>
      
	  <p>Such a cheer gushed up from the square that any kid in Durmont who hadn’t known about the aurora knew it now.</p>
      
	  <p>“I know y’all are keen to sling some snow—I’m itchin’ to myself—but as I’m seein’ a few new faces here tonight, I’d like to refresh y’all on the rules of the game.</p>
      
      <p>“There’s really only one: stay on your board. Fall off, you’re out. Don’t try to keep playing if you fall, ’cause I don’t take kindly to wetcoats, and the light makes ’em easy to spot. Last one standin’ wins. Questions?”</p>
      
      <p>A small, sweatered arm trembled up.</p>
      
      <p>“One more thing,” Berg added, ignoring it. “This goes almost without sayin’—nail a Hotbot, you win automatically. Just ’cause it’s never happened don’t mean it won’t tonight.”</p>
      
      <p>A second cheer promised demise to any local Hotbots. Linus couldn’t help but join; the idea was ludicrous (any ’bot-bound snowball soaring half a mile above the ground would be vaporized), but romantic in its own way.</p>
      
      <p>“Right then,” said Berg. “<caps>FIGHT!</caps>”</p>
      
	  <p>In the first second of play, Durmont’s children relocated Icing Square’s top layer onto each other. In the second it became clear none of them had been knocked off-board, for none had boarded yet; an armistice was called to corrects this.</p>
      
      <p>Locking boot in board, Linus kicked off and rode the square’s north slope ere anyone could peg him, scooping ammunition. Boarding and ’balling came as naturally to him as to any child on the continent. And the head under his cap was better than most, so his chances tonight were fair at worst. Frozen water sailed by in balls, bombs, bullets, pieces, parcels, packages, and still more units that defied description, hurled from unseen hands at unseen targets, bursting in shimmering showers.</p>
      
	  <p>Some younger coats were wetting in the distance (without his help; Linus targeted none smaller than himself). Others fled their assailants on wobbly knees. The gullible ones rode off for Hotbots to harry. One of the cleverest had spent the battle’s risky opening act erecting a tiny fort, hoping to camp until the competition was downed. But most engaged in mobile melees, exchanging frantic fire as they wove around each other. Linus felled three early in the game this way.</p>
      
      <p>He could recall no dream so beautiful, so amazingly unreal, as snow under Southern Lights. His board-edge tossed it in a spray of jewels, each one grain of trillions, each a priceless treasure. Above the crunch, the moon had turned modestly from the ravishing aurora, forgotten by all souls but Linus’s. His name, though Greek, resembled her Latin one, so he respected her as a kind of patron. <em>Please help me win</em>, he prayed, <em>and spare me some of your albedo</em>.</p>
      
	  <p>The combat had fanned out fast from Icing Square, down the precarious face of Barrel Hill, before descending to the northern neighborhoods, where the ranks thinned—Linus’s work as much as Berg’s.</p>
      
      <p>Only before the driveway snowmen did he find himself materially threatened. Near misses by his ears prefaced a blow on his left arm, and another on his chest. Berg means business. Linus arced around the houses to reload. More bursts sounded behind him. Not a red hair in sight, and the shots kept coming! Shuddering, Linus sought the safety of the nearest driveway.</p>
      
      <p>By the time he realized his mistake, the decoy slingers had broken off and Berg was behind him with an armload, teeth bared, face splashed with magnetic light. Linus dug his heels and spun to escape, but before he could get clear Berg dropped his snowballs and seized Linus by the wrists.</p>
      
      <p>“Lovely aurora we’re having, eh, Linatic?”</p>
      
      <p>“This is a light fight,” Linus grunted, “not a sumo match!”</p>
      
      <p>“Suit yourself,” Berg said and turned Linus loose. Linus’s fingers told him why before his eyes caught Berg’s true spoils: Linus’s gloves! The thief dashed off, hooting like a hyena, into the street. His genius smarted to admit. Linus was still in the game, but fingers bared, his offense was all but crippled.</p>
      
      <p>The gnaw at his knuckles settled him. Those were nice gloves. If he had to brave the ground’s cold fire long enough to gather bombs for his rival, so be it. Blue eyes burning, he pushed off—</p>
      
      <p>And stopped in time to notice one of two important sights.</p>
      
      <p>The one he noticed was the red penguin scarf fluttering below Barrel Hill. Clare, the referee, was watching.</p>
      
      <p>The other sight was the maybe twenty snowballs zinging at him.</p>
      
      <p>By the time he noticed the second, every snowball had done its work. He heard nothing over the ringing in his ears, saw nothing past his eyelids. Sliding them up, he stared into the carrot nose of a grinning snowman.</p>
      
      <p>That meant he was on his back, ungloved <em>and</em> unboarded. The night was Berg’s. A snow-spray on his cheek announced the champion’s snowboard inches from his face.</p>
      
      <p>“Better luck next time, Linus-infection.”</p>
      
      <p>Soggy-bottomed suck-ups chittered at the pun. Clare didn’t, but she saw the whole affair.</p>
      
      <p>Snowflakes sizzled on Linus’s cheeks. Pressure built inside him, a steam-plume in a valveless boiler. Too heavy for one heart to hold—too weighty to drop—too far gone to salvage—!</p>
      
      <p>As if the Southern Lights burned out, his world went color-clear. Nothing mattered. He leapt up, pulled the spring in his arm, loosed a cry from of its laryngeal prison, and drove his naked fist through the snowman’s head.</p>
    
      <p>For one blissful moment, nothing at all happened.</p>
      
      <p>Then his nerves screamed, his knuckles bled, the snowman’s carrot dropped, and the rest of the head tumbled beside it. Reality rushed back as fast as it had fled, more distasteful yet.</p>
      
      <p>Berg liked it better. Delighting in the beheading, he seemed about to congratulate the beheader.</p>
      
      <p>Clare’s face stung Linus worse. Tears trickled down her cheek, each more destructive to his spirits than a meteor to the taiga.</p>
      
      <p>“That snowman,” breathed Berg in sudden recognition. “Clare, did <em>you</em>—?”</p>
      
      <p>With a silent nod she demolished the last of Linus’s happiness. He’d broken what she’d built. It was almost too stupid for truth. Where anger had found its outlet, misery found none. With no apology to offer beyond a doleful shake of his head, Linus grabbed his board and trudged homeward up the hill, all thoughts of gloves forsaken.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>
      
      <p class="first"><caps>Solstice eve</caps> found him once again by the window, staring into the black. Cold-cured Sallust was gone (class party, most likely) and their parents too (same story at the office), leaving poor Linus with only the moon for company.</p>
      
      <p>The traitor. Linus had made a legitimate, celestially binding request, and she’d straight-up spat on it. After some sulking he recalled that the moon has two sides, one bright and one dark, and while it’s easy to forget the side one isn’t facing, one needs both to understand the whole.</p>
      
      <p><em>She’s just like me.</em> It comforted him not a bit.</p>
      
      <p>The darker side of his own heart, long a source of shame, was swelling into a source of genuine fear. The snowman was in a different league from the snapped pencils and shattered game controllers of his youth: its death had brutalized another, the very last person he wished to wrong. No longer could he vent the selfish surges of his heart’s reverse.</p>
      
      <p>But let the rest keep preaching self-control. Who among them had ever felt enough to need it? Durmonters were as cold and as hard as the tundra they trod. For all their hardiness, they were broken people: the proctor (all your rules and no justice); Sallust (can’t wear a stupid scarf for Mom?); Berg (how piquant must you find my pique!); even sweet, smart Clare (fine choice in friends, lady). <em>Sensitivity, my gift and curse.</em> Linus was alone in it.</p>
      
      <p>Slogging through such thoughts, he took a while to heed the news seeping from the living room television. A follow-up to the story from two nights ago, on sagging geothermal yields. Evidently it was serious enough to merit the Energy Minister’s attention, and his comments did nothing to improve Linus’s mood.</p>
      
      <p>Could the Vents really be losing their heat?</p>
      
      <p>Could the earth really be revoking the gift of life?</p>
      
      <p>Was he going to take it sitting down?</p>
      
      <p>Determined to answer at least one of these questions in the negative, and without anything better to do or anyone to stop him, he rolled off the windowsill and headed for the board closet.</p>
      
      <div class="break"></div>
      
      <p class="first"><caps>Two and a half</caps> miles later, Linus kicked up to a forbidding iron gate around a cone of crags and catwalks. The runner-up on <em>Dukedom’s Direst Deathtraps</em>, Durmont Vent was denied to the world by two security boxes, each staffed by a snoozing sentry who, carefully and independently of his partner, had pitted duty against drunkenness and decided as any minimum-wage guard must on Solstice Eve. Those details weren’t all known to Linus, but they go a long way to explain how an eighth-grader got inside a <em>Dukedom’s Direst Deathtrap</em>.</p>
      
      <p>The first thing a visitor to Durmont Vent (or any, for that matter) will notice is the heat. Linus had never felt such astounding heat—not in the shower, not in a bowl of soup, not even when his hand learned heat from the fireplace in the den. Yet for all its power, he knew this heat wasn’t what it should be. His skin hadn’t even started melting.</p>
      
      <p>Behind a second iron gate, a half-paved path led Linus to a hole in the mountain, where it ossified into what a sign above it called the Tungsten Way. This was the catwalk that connected the outside to the inside of the mountain. Linus had spotted traces of it on arrival and supposed it to have been forged to withstand the planet’s generous emissions. Today, though, such precautions seemed unnecessary; Linus himself remained alive enough to assume his own melting point was lower than tungsten’s.</p>
      
      <p>Pulse quickening with warmth and dread, he crept along as quietly as possible, deciding whether he dared approach the railing, until an overpowering heat-blast announced the  mountain’s core. Ahead, the walls ended and the Tungsten Way ran out steps shy of a ledge. It looked unnatural, this ledge, and that got Linus wondering how many ancestors had died finishing it in the Vent’s ardent youth. Wagering he wouldn’t share their fate, Linus sucked in the deepest breath he could hold and stepped out onto it.</p>
      
      <p>It was like looking into hell itself. Durmont Vent dropped deeper than he could gauge, brewing all manner of blazing liquids, gases, plasmas, and who knew what other phases of matter. Here it was, the naked planet. So unlike Antarctica! Free of every frosty pretension that ever beset those dreary slopes! The bare lonely planet called Earth, exposed in all its strength, all its weakness, all its earnest ardor before him. This hole had been his life’s object all along, and only a string of unpleasing bumps against lukewarm human hearts could have induced him to seek it.</p>
      
      <p>The moment he saw this hot orange pit was all there was, Linus had to smile. Antarctica was such a cold place, it’d wear anybody out to warm it up.</p>
      
      <p>“Hello, Earth,” he whispered, lying facedown on the ledge. “It’s me, Linus. You need heat—I know, I heard on the news, but I think I always suspected. Anyway, I want to help you out.</p>
      
      <p>“You see, Earth, I got more heat in me than I know what to do with. All my life I’ve been burning my family, my friends, even myself, ’cause I never knew how to deal with growing up hot in a freezing world. I still don’t know. But I’m not asking you to help me with my problems, Earth—made that mistake with your friend the moon. All I ask is, lemme help you with yours.”</p>
      
      <p>Tears steamed through holes in the bottom of the ledge, swirling in the radiant cloud.</p>
     
      <p>“Please, Earth. Take my heat—I don’t need it. Take it and use it to rejuvenate this continent. Give it to the folks who need it: Mom, Dad, Sallust, Clare. Even Berg. Please, it’s yours… just <em>tell me what to do</em>!”</p>
      
      <p>“Why don’t you try jumpin’ in, Linatic?”</p>
      
      <p>No. No way. Not here.</p>
      
      <p>Rolling gently onto his back, Linus glared up at the one red mane he least wanted to see.</p>
      
      <p>“How sweet you are”—Berg leaned over, until their faces were inches apart—“savin’ some of yourself for me. Alas, don’t reckon I want any.”</p>
      
      <p>Linus was on him like a lion before he could suck another breath from this sacred place, tearing at his shirt with indignant claws.</p>
      
      <p>“You followed me, you bastard? Why?”</p>
      
      <p><em>You’ve no right to be here.</em></p>
      
      <p>“I only w-wanted—to help—the Vent,” wheezed writhing Berg.</p>
      
      <p><em>You’ll mock me to the end.</em></p>
      
      <p>“This Vent doesn’t need you,” Linus snarled, clamping a hand over that hateful mouth, and grappled with him in spinning slow-dance that ended with Berg dangling over the edge of eternity.</p>
      
      <p>“This world doesn’t need you!”</p>
      
      <p>The gravity of it took time pulling on Linus. Chest heaving, his eyes flickered, thrilled to watch Berg hang. One toss could cure this world of a too-long-suffered blight. As delicious as this prospect was the power to draw it out. Fear was etched on that face—real, unscripted fear—and it was so</p>
      
      <p><em>So</em></p>
      
      <p>Disgusting.</p>
      
      <p>Disgusting that Berg had driven him to this, and disgusting that Linus had let him. Disgusting all of it.</p>
      
      <p>Without another word, Linus pulled the rattled boy into his aching arms and started dragging him down the mountain.</p>
      
      <p>When their boots found snow, Berg dusted himself off with Linus’s aid, and the pair entered an awkward understanding. It might have been that a show of earnest emotion had penetrated Berg at last; or else the heat had overcome his head. Whichever it was, he seemed too listless to avenge himself. He bid Linus a halfhearted happy Solstice in front of the security boxes, where the guards snoozed on, none the wiser.</p>
      
      <p>Linus watched, stock still, until Berg’s board disappeared on the horizon. Then he took a step. One was enough for the ordeal’s heft to fell him. His knees hit the powder, and he didn’t try to pull them up. <em>How white this country is</em>, he mused, and the world began to swim.</p>
      
	 <p>A second later, he felt himself compressed by something plush. A tickle on his chin advised him to open his eyes. A penguin smiled at him between two winter-coated arms, assuring Linus he was safe: from the air’s cold bite, from the raging heat beneath, from a thousand discouragements and insecurities.</p>
        
     <p>At least until the moon’s next rise.</p>
